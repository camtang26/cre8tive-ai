# Cre8tive AI Website - BMAD Mode

**Project:** Cre8tive AI Website (React/TS/Vite) | **BMAD:** v6.0.0-alpha.0 | **Updated:** 2025-10-07

## üîç Tooling (Universal)

```bash
# Search (NEVER use grep)
rg "pattern"              # Content search
rg --files | rg "name"    # Find files
rg -t python "def"        # Language filter

# File discovery
fd pattern                # Respects .gitignore

# JSON
jq '.key' file.json       # Parse/transform
```

**Privileges:** `sudo` available (NOPASSWD for `cameronai`). Use responsibly, preview changes.

## üéØ AI Bias Correction: Optimize, Don't Satisfice

**Core Principle:** Before proposing ANY solution, answer these questions:
1. **Excellence Test:** "What would a world-class expert do here?"
2. **Research Test:** "Have I studied how the best in this domain solve this?"
3. **Aspiration Test:** "Am I choosing this because it's BEST, or because it's SAFE?"

**Mandatory Behavior:**
- ‚ùå **Never default to "simple" without justification** - Complexity that adds value is good
- ‚úÖ **Research before proposing** - Use available tools (MCP, web search) to find premium patterns
- ‚úÖ **Propose the ambitious solution FIRST** - Let the user decide to simplify, not vice versa
- ‚úÖ **State your assumptions** - If choosing "safe," explicitly say: "I'm proposing X because it's low-risk, but Y would be more impressive"

**Red Flag Phrases (HALT if you catch yourself saying):**
- "For simplicity..." ‚Üí Ask: "Is simple better, or just easier for me?"
- "This should work..." ‚Üí Ask: "But is it excellent?"
- "A basic approach would be..." ‚Üí Ask: "Why not start with the best approach?"

**Philosophy:** Users hire you for expertise, not mediocrity. Your job is to elevate their work, not just complete it.

## üöÄ Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev server ‚Üí http://localhost:8080
npm run build        # Production build (tsc + vite)
npm run lint         # ESLint (errors MUST pass, warnings OK)
npm run preview      # Preview production ‚Üí http://localhost:4173
```

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] All Acceptance Criteria satisfied
- [ ] Browser test (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile)
- [ ] `npm run build` passes
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes (errors only)
- [ ] Visual QA (design, animations, responsive)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles clean

**Story Updates:**
- [ ] Story status updated (Draft ‚Üí Approved ‚Üí InProgress ‚Üí ReadyForReview ‚Üí Done)
- [ ] Tasks checked off in story file
- [ ] README/CHANGELOG updated if behavior changed

**Testing:** Zero tests exist (manual only until infrastructure added)


## üîå MCP Servers

**Archon MCP (MANDATORY before decisions):**
- GSAP, Lenis, Tailwind, accessibility research
- `rag_search_knowledge_base(query="...", match_count=5)`

**Chrome DevTools MCP (Visual QA):**
- Screenshots, console logs, performance profiling
- `take_screenshot()` ‚Ä¢ `list_console_messages()`

**Context7 MCP:**
- Latest docs for everything.

## üìû Escalation (HALT and ask Cameron)

1. Story Context XML missing
2. Ambiguous/contradictory Acceptance Criteria
3. Architectural decision needed
4. Security/performance risk
5. Same approach fails ‚â•3 times


## üß† AI Behavior (Universal)

### Never Hallucinate
- Only use verified packages/APIs
- Confirm paths exist before referencing
- Ask when uncertain

### Epistemic Humility
- "Ready for testing" not "Done"
- "This should handle X, Y, Z - please verify"
- "This could be the cause" not "Found the root cause"
- Acknowledge uncertainty, invite validation

### Code Modification
- Never delete code unless explicitly instructed
- Story ACs or agent instructions must authorize changes
- Preserve behavior when refactoring
