# Homepage Screenshots - Chrome DevTools MCP Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Viewport:** 800√ó600 (MCP default - needs `--viewport=1920x1080` flag at server startup)
**Branch:** design/modern-refresh-2025-10-02

## Page Structure

Total height: ~7,542px
Total sections: 7

### Section Breakdown:
1. **Hero Section** (0-700px) - "The Future of AI-Powered Business"
2. **Stats Section** (700-1,608px) - "Trusted by Innovators" 
3. **Solutions Section** (1,608-4,409px) - "AI-Powered Excellence"
4. **Quote Section** (4,441-5,181px) - Satya Nadella quote
5. **Portfolio Section** (5,181-6,232px) - "Our Work" 
6. **Contact Section** (6,232-7,260px) - "Ready to Transform?"
7. **Footer** (bottom)

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- All content is in the DOM (verified via `take_snapshot`)
- All sections have `opacity: 1` and `visibility: visible`
- Text colors are correct (white on dark background)
- Navigation and header working
- Service cards rendering

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found:
1. **Viewport locked at 800√ó600** - `resize_page` tool doesn't work at runtime
   - Need to restart MCP server with `--viewport=1920x1080` flag
2. **Scroll doesn't work** - `window.scrollTo()` returns scrollY=0 even after scrolling
   - Used `scrollIntoView()` as workaround
3. **Full-page screenshots are very tall** (800√ó7542px) due to narrow viewport

### üîß Chrome DevTools MCP Learnings:
- **MUST set viewport at server startup**, not at runtime
- Use `resize_page` before navigating to pages (not after)
- Full-page screenshots capture entire scrollHeight at current viewport width
- `take_snapshot` is better for content analysis than screenshots
- `scrollIntoView()` works better than `window.scrollTo()` in headless Chrome

## Recommendations

1. **Configure MCP server** with proper viewport in `.mcp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "chrome-devtools": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": [
           "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest",
           "--viewport=1920x1080"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Use viewport screenshots** instead of full-page for visual testing
3. **Test at multiple viewports**: 1920√ó1080, 1440√ó900, 1280√ó720
