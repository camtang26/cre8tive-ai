Instead of open-ended prompting, you complete guided fields and receive a storyboard with scenes, copy, and platform specs automatically aligned to your brief."},{question:"How quickly will I see a storyboard?",answer:"Most teams review a polished storyboard during their first session. The Studio team joins as soon as you’re happy with the direction so production planning can start immediately."},{question:"Do I need AI expertise to use this?",answer:"No. The intake is written in plain language—campaign goal, audience, tone, references, approvals. We translate that into production-ready outputs so you never have to write prompts."},{question:"What makes the storyboard production-ready?",answer:"Each delivery includes a scene-by-scene outline, suggested copy, camera and motion notes, aspect-ratio crops, and downloadable assets so directors and editors can move straight into execution."},{question:"Can I use the storyboard without hiring your Studio?",answer:"Yes. Export the PDF and share it with any internal or external crew. When you want our Studio involved, the same storyboard hands off directly into their workflow."},{question:"How customizable are the visual directions?",answer:"You can start from curated directions and then tweak palette, typography, motion cues, and references until it reflects your brand. Nothing is locked to templates."},{question:"Can agencies manage multiple clients?",answer:"Absolutely. Each brief keeps its own guardrails, approvers, and visual direction so you can maintain separate client workstreams without context overlap."},{question:"How do you handle different industries?",answer:"The intake captures industry context and compliance requirements. Our team reviews the output alongside the AI so regulated or niche sectors still receive accurate messaging."},{question:"What support do I get from the Studio team?",answer:"A producer schedules your kickoff, a creative director validates the narrative, and specialists oversee color, motion, and sound so the final video matches the storyboard."},{question:"How can I experience the platform?",answer:"Start a brief to see the workflow end-to-end, then book a call with our Studio to plan production, pricing, and rollout."}],q=()=>u.jsxs("section",{className:"relative isolate mx-auto max-w-[920px] px-4 py-20",children:[u.jsx("div",{className:"absolute inset-0 -z-10 rounded-[36px] border border-white/10 bg-gradient-to-br from-black/65 via-black/55 to-black/70","aria-hidden":!0}),u.jsxs("div",{className:"flex flex-col gap-8",children:[u.jsxs("div",{className:"text-center space-y-4",children:[u.jsx("p",{className:"text-xs font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.5em] text-white/60",children:"Frequently Asked"}),u.jsx("h2",{className:"text-4xl font-black tracking-tight text-white md:text-5xl",children:"Answers Before You Get Started"}),u.jsx("p",{className:"mx-auto max-w-2xl text-base leading-relaxed text-white/70 md:text-lg",children:"The briefing engine is designed for clarity.
