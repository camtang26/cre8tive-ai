# Universal Research Framing Guide

## The Core Principle

**User provides specific problems** → **Extract universal domains** → **Frame research for mastery**

## The Pattern

### Step 1: User Problems Are Data Points

Step 0.5 captures specific user issues:
- "Inter font feels cramped, spacing too tight"
- "White/teal text has bad contrast on blue gradient"
- "Want depth like Stripe has"
- "Skor animation is 10-phase sequence"

**These are SIGNALS** (which domains matter), not RESEARCH TOPICS.

### Step 2: Extract Universal Domains

From each specific problem, identify the UNIVERSAL domain:

| Specific Problem | Universal Domain |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "Inter feels cramped" | Typography systems mastery |
| "White/teal contrast bad" | Text readability & contrast principles |
| "Like Stripe's depth" | Visual depth techniques |
| "Skor 10-phase animation" | Complex animated UI sequences |
| "Defaulting to primitives" | Component architecture decisions |
| "Using power2 easing" | Animation choreography & easing mastery |

**The extraction**: What MASTERY would prevent this type of problem in ANY project?

### Step 3: Frame Research Universally

**NARROW Framing** (Problem-Solving):
- "Research Inter font spacing optimization techniques"
- "Research white/teal text color rules for dark blue gradients"
- "Analyze Stripe's shadow implementation in detail"
- "Research Skor-style 10-phase animation patterns"

**UNIVERSAL Framing** (Mastery):
- "Research typography systems mastery for premium experiences"
- "Research text readability and contrast principles for premium interfaces"
- "Research visual depth techniques from DIVERSE premium sources"
- "Research complex animated UI sequence mastery"

## Detailed Examples Across Domains

### Example 1: Typography Domain

**User Problem** (from Step 0.5):
> "Typography feels cramped - Inter font at 16px with tight line-height, white text on dark blue gradient is unreadable, headings too small"

**Extract Universal Domain** (Step 3):
Typography Systems & Text Readability Mastery

**Frame Research Prompt** (Step 4):

❌ NARROW:
"Research Inter font optimization: spacing fixes, white text rules for dark blue gradients, heading size recommendations for SaaS landing pages"

✅ UNIVERSAL:
"Research typography systems mastery for premium experiences - fluid type scales, systematic spacing principles, text readability and contrast for any palette, premium font execution techniques, generous layout principles"

**Why UNIVERSAL wins**: Works for any font, any color scheme, any project style.

### Example 2: Visual Quality Domain

**User Problem** (from Step 0.5):
> "Components feel flat, need more depth. I like how Stripe uses shadows and gradients."

**Extract Universal Domain** (Step 3):
Visual Design & Depth Mastery

**Frame Research Prompt** (Step 4):

❌ NARROW:
"Analyze Stripe.com shadow and gradient techniques in detail, extract their specific implementations"

✅ UNIVERSAL:
"Research visual design mastery for premium landing pages - discover depth techniques through DIVERSE premium examples across industries and styles. Shadow systems, glassmorphism, light simulation, material quality. Critically explore varied sources, avoid defaulting to familiar sites."

**Why UNIVERSAL wins**: Discovers patterns through breadth, not assumes Stripe is the model. Works for any visual style.

---

### Example 3: Animation Domain

**User Problem** (from Step 0.5):
> "Animations feel mechanical, using wrong easing. Want organic motion like premium sites have."

**Extract Universal Domain** (Step 3):
Animation Choreography & Timing Mastery

**Frame Research Prompt** (Step 4):

❌ NARROW:
"Research when to use expo.out vs power2.out vs elastic easing specifically for hero animations"

✅ UNIVERSAL:
"Research animation choreography mastery for premium landing pages - easing frameworks and selection principles, premium timing techniques, organic motion creation, performance optimization, ScrollTrigger patterns"

**Why UNIVERSAL wins**: Teaches easing JUDGMENT (any context), not prescriptive "use expo for heroes".

---

### Example 4: Complex Sequences Domain

**User Problem** (from Step 0.5):
> "Building Skor animation - 10 phases, typewriter effect, auto-scroll, loops infinitely. Complex state management."

**Extract Universal Domain** (Step 3):
Complex Animated UI Sequence Mastery

**Frame Research Prompt** (Step 4):

❌ NARROW:
"Research Skor-style animation patterns: 10-phase sequences, typewriter timing, auto-scroll implementation, infinite loop management for email verification flows"

✅ UNIVERSAL:
"Research complex animated UI sequence mastery - multi-phase flows, state management for animation choreography, timeline orchestration, typewriter effects, auto-scroll cinematics, infinite loop strategies, performance for complex experiences. Applicable to product demos, interactive tours, tech showcases."

**Why UNIVERSAL wins**: Covers Skor's needs but also works for ANY complex animated sequence.

## Self-Assessment Checklist

**After identifying research areas (Step 3)**:
- [ ] Each area is a DOMAIN (typography, visual, animation) not a PROBLEM (cramped Inter, bad contrast)
- [ ] Each area applicable to ANY premium landing page (not just this project)
- [ ] No brand/project-specific terms in area names ("CashFlo", "Skor", specific colors/fonts)
- [ ] Extracted universal principle from user's specific example

**After creating research prompts (Step 4)**:
- [ ] Prompt teaches MASTERY not FIXES
- [ ] No project-specific examples in prompt ("white/teal", "Inter", "Skor", "CashFlo")
- [ ] No familiar source bias ("analyze Stripe/Ramp/Linear")
- [ ] Emphasizes PRINCIPLES and JUDGMENT (not prescriptive rules)
- [ ] Diversity encouraged where appropriate ("explore DIVERSE sources")
- [ ] Test: "Would this research be valuable for my NEXT project?" (If NO, too narrow)

**If any checkbox fails, reframe more universally.**

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Using user's specific examples as research topics
❌ Assuming familiar sources are the best sources
❌ Researching "how to solve X" instead of "mastery in domain where X occurred"
❌ Including project-specific constraints in research focus
❌ Prescriptive rules instead of judgment frameworks

✅ Extract universal domain from user's specific problem
✅ Discover patterns through diverse sources (breadth over depth on familiar)
✅ Research domain mastery broadly applicable
✅ Universal principles work across projects/brands/styles
✅ Teach judgment development, not prescriptive "always do X"
