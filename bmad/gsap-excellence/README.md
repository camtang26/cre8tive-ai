# GSAP Excellence Engine

A specialized BMAD module delivering premium GSAP animations powered by GSAP 3.13+ (all premium plugins FREE).

## 📚 Essential Reading

**Before using this module, read [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md).** This guide explains the agent selection process, workflow routing, and pattern library usage.

## Overview

The GSAP Excellence Engine solves a critical problem: AI models consistently produce underwhelming, safe, and generic GSAP animations. This module provides specialized agents and workflows that encode deep GSAP expertise, ambitious design thinking, and quality-first implementation patterns.

**🎉 2025 Game-Changer:** GSAP 3.13+ made ALL premium plugins FREE (ScrollSmoother, MorphSVG, SplitText, DrawSVG, MotionPath - formerly $99/year each). This module actively leverages these premium features!

## Module Structure

### 🤖 `/agents`

Five specialized agents modeled as a film studio crew:

- **Director** (`gsap-director`) - Vision keeper and production orchestrator
- **Cinematographer** (`gsap-cinematographer`) - Research specialist and motion design expert
- **VFX Artist** (`gsap-vfx`) - Implementation specialist for complex animations
- **Editor** (`gsap-editor`) - Debugging, refinement, and timing polish
- **Tech Director** (`gsap-tech-director`) - Performance and production readiness validation

### 📋 `/workflows`

28 production workflows from creative ideation to validated delivery:

**Signature Workflows:**
- `creative-ideation` - Generate 3-5 premium concepts backed by research
- `animation-production` - Complete production pipeline using all 5 agents
- `implement-from-pattern` - Quick implementation from 60-pattern library

**Validation & Quality:**
- `validate-60fps` - Systematic performance validation with CPU throttling
- `memory-profiling` - Heap snapshot-based memory leak detection
- `accessibility-audit` - WCAG compliance validation
- `validate-modern` - GSAP 3.13+ compliance scanning

**Specialized Production:**
- `research-gsap-pattern` - Multi-source deep research (Archon + Context7 + Web)
- `debug-animation` - Fix jank, timing issues, visual glitches
- `optimize-performance` - 60fps profiling and optimization
- `refine-timing` - Polish choreography and easing curves
- `harvest-patterns` - Extract successful animations as reusable patterns

And 16 more agent-specific workflows for specialized tasks.

### 📚 `/patterns`

60 production-ready GSAP patterns organized by category:
- Loading Sequences (5) - Grid intros, cart drawers, hero reveals
- Text Animations (6) - SplitText reveals, elastic effects
- Scroll Effects (8) - Parallax, pin+scrub, velocity-based
- Premium Showcases (15) - ScrollSmoother, MorphSVG, MotionPath combos (FREE in 3.13+!)
- Layout Transitions (4) - FLIP state changes, modals
- Next.js Patterns (5) - SSR-safe, route transitions
- Interactive (5) - Drag, magnetic hover, cursor-follow
- And more...

### 📖 `/knowledge`

Domain-specific knowledge bases integrated into agent personas for expert-level guidance.

### 🧪 `/checklists`

Reference checklists for systematic quality validation:
- 10-point pitfall analysis
- Performance optimization checklist
- Accessibility validation standards

## Quick Start

```bash
# Load the Director agent (recommended entry point)
/bmad:gsap-excellence:agents:gsap-director

# Once loaded, the agent offers a menu. Common commands:
*status      # Check workflow recommendations
*plan        # Generate premium animation concepts
*production  # Full production pipeline (all 5 agents)
*implement   # Quick implementation from pattern library
```

## Key Concepts

### Premium-First Mindset

GSAP 3.13+ made all premium plugins FREE. This module:
- Actively recommends ScrollSmoother, MorphSVG, SplitText, DrawSVG, MotionPath
- No "cost-conscious" suggestions - premium IS the standard
- Pattern library showcases premium plugin combinations

### Multi-Source Research Protocol

Workflows leverage three research tiers:
1. **Archon MCP** - 89 GSAP documentation sources, 2.2M+ words
2. **Context7 MCP** - Latest API documentation
3. **Web Search** - 2025-specific trends and premium examples

### Quality Standards

Every animation delivery must meet:
- 60fps on mid-range devices (CPU throttle 4x validation)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` compliance
- Zero console errors, proper cleanup
- Natural easing curves (no linear defaults)
- Purpose-driven design (not decoration)

### Film Studio Workflow

Agents coordinate like a production crew:
- **Director** sets vision and coordinates specialists
- **Cinematographer** researches techniques and timing
- **VFX Artist** implements ambitious animations
- **Editor** refines and debugs
- **Tech Director** validates performance and readiness

## MCP Server Requirements

This module requires four MCP servers:
- **Archon MCP** - GSAP documentation in RAG database
- **Context7 MCP** - Latest library docs
- **Perplexity MCP** - Premium example research (optional)
- **Chrome DevTools MCP** - Visual/performance testing

## Integration with BMad Core

GSAP Excellence integrates with BMad Core framework:
- Agent execution engine
- Workflow orchestration via `workflow.xml`
- Menu-driven command interface
- Slash command registration

## Related Documentation

- [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) - **Start here!** Comprehensive usage guide
- [EXAMPLES.md](./EXAMPLES.md) - Real-world usage scenarios
- Workflow READMEs - Each workflow has detailed documentation

## Best Practices

1. **Start with the Director** - Let the lead agent route you to specialists
2. **Use the pattern library** - 60 production-ready patterns available
3. **Validate systematically** - Use `validate-60fps` and `accessibility-audit`
4. **Leverage premium plugins** - They're FREE in 3.13+, use them!

## Philosophy

**"Optimize, Don't Satisfice"**

This module fights AI's tendency toward mediocrity by:
- Encoding deep GSAP expertise in agent personas
- Enforcing research protocols before implementation
- Validating performance and quality systematically
- Using premium patterns as the baseline

The goal: Animations that look human-crafted, not AI-generated.
