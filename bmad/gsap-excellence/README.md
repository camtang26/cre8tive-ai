# GSAP Excellence Engine

**Fight AI mediocrity with premium GSAP animations**

## Overview

The GSAP Excellence Engine solves a critical problem in AI-assisted development: AI models consistently produce underwhelming, safe, and generic GSAP animations that fail to showcase the framework's true potential.

This module provides specialized agents and workflows that fight AI's natural tendency toward mediocrity by encoding deep GSAP expertise, ambitious design thinking, and quality-first implementation patterns.

### Key Features

- **5 Specialized Agents** - Film studio crew (Director, Cinematographer, VFX Artist, Editor, Tech Director)
- **10 Workflows** - From creative ideation to production-ready implementation
- **Multi-Source Research** - Archon MCP + Context7 + Perplexity for premium patterns
- **Visual Validation** - Chrome DevTools MCP for performance and quality testing
- **Pattern Library** - Growing collection of proven premium GSAP animations
- **60fps Standard** - Performance targets enforced across all deliveries

### Target Users

AI-assisted developers (100% AI-powered workflow) who demand premium results and refuse to accept mediocre animation output.

## Installation

```bash
# Module is located at: /home/cameronai/projects/cre8tive-website-1006/bmad/gsap-excellence
# Run BMAD installer to register module
```

## Quick Start

**User-Guided Studio Flow**

The GSAP Excellence Engine works through a **user-guided specialist workflow**:

**1. Start with The Director** (`/gsap-director`)
```
Tell The Director what animation you need:
"I want a premium hero section animation with parallax"

The Director analyzes your needs and creates a routing plan:
- Which specialists you need (Cinematographer, VFX Artist, etc.)
- What order to use them in
- What to tell each specialist
```

**2. Follow The Director's Routing**
```
Director: "This needs research. Run /gsap-cinematographer with *research"

You: /gsap-cinematographer ‚Üí complete research

You: Return to Director with findings

Director: "Great research! Now run /gsap-vfx with *implement"

You: /gsap-vfx ‚Üí complete implementation

You: Return to Director for validation
```

**3. Director as Your Hub**
```
- Come to Director when you need guidance
- Director reviews specialist work for quality
- Director tells you what's next or validates you're done
```

- 80%+ user satisfaction with premium quality
- 30-60 minute delivery time (concept to production)

## Quality Standards

**Code Quality:**
- 60fps on mid-range devices (CPU throttle 4x)
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Browser support: Chrome, Firefox, Safari (latest 2 versions)
- No console errors, proper cleanup

- Purpose-driven (not decoration for decoration's sake)

## Pattern Library

The pattern library grows organically as animations are created and validated.

**Pattern Format:**
```yaml
id: pattern-{uuid}
name: "Pattern Name"
category: "scroll-effects" | "timelines" | "interactions"
complexity: "simple" | "medium" | "high"
gsap_version: "3.12.0"
plugins_required: ["ScrollTrigger", "SplitText"]
description: "Brief description"
inspiration_source: "Citation"
performance_notes: "60fps with GPU acceleration"
code_example: |
  gsap.to(element, { ... })
created_date: "2025-10-11"
tags: ["parallax", "scroll", "premium"]
```

## Contributing

To extend this module:

1. **Add agents:** Use `create-agent` workflow with film studio role
2. **Add workflows:** Use `create-workflow` workflow
3. **Add patterns:** Save successful animations to pattern library
4. **Follow quality standards:** 60fps, accessibility, browser support

## Philosophy

**"Optimize, Don't Satisfice"**

This module fights AI's natural tendency toward safe, mediocre solutions. Every agent is trained to:
- Push for better, not just "good enough"
- Research deeper into premium patterns
- Implement with ambition
- Validate with rigor

The result: Animations that look human-crafted, not AI-generated.
