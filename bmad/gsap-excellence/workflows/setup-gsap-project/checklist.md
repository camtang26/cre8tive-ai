## Next Steps After Validation

Once all checkboxes are checked:

1. âœ… **Start Building Animations**
   - Use `creative-ideation` workflow for concepts
   - Use `implement-from-pattern` for proven patterns
   - Use `research-gsap-pattern` for deep dives

2. âœ… **Establish Baselines**
   - Document initial performance metrics
   - Note bundle sizes
   - Record FPS baselines

3. âœ… **Team Onboarding**
   - Share setup guide with team
   - Review best practices
   - Establish animation review process
