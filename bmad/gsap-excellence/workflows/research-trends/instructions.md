### TIER 2: Deep-Research Section 7.5 - Agency Pattern Framework (MANDATORY)

<phase n="2" title="Deep-Research Section 7.5 - Notable Agencies & Patterns" required="true">

<action>Read COMPLETE Deep-Research Section 7.5 to load agency pattern framework</action>

**Read:** {project-root}/docs/Deep-Research/GSAP-Animation-Mastery/32-75-notable-agencies-patterns.md

**Extract and apply:**

**1. Agency Pattern Framework:**

**Active Theory Pattern:**
> *"Known for WebGL + GSAP. They often have immersive experiences. Pattern: heavy use of GSAP for camera moves and syncing DOM/UI with WebGL scenes."*
(Source: 32-75-notable-agencies-patterns.md)

**Application:** Are 2024-2025 trends showing more WebGL + GSAP integration? Is DOM/WebGL syncing becoming standard?

**Resn Pattern:**
> *"Often quirky interactive pieces. They might use a lot of unique easings and playful SVG animations. Pattern: creative use of custom eases and staggers to create surprising motions (like bouncing letters or liquid effects). Possibly use custom plugins (like CustomWiggle or CustomBounce)."*
(Source: 32-75-notable-agencies-patterns.md)

**Application:** Are custom easings trending? Is playful motion design gaining vs. corporate minimalism?

**ToyFight Pattern:**
> *"They integrated GSAP deep in Webflow site, showing that mixing GSAP with content management is feasible. Pattern: they used Eleventy and vanilla JS for transparency. Their work likely emphasizes precise, minimalistic animations aligning with design."*
(Source: 32-75-notable-agencies-patterns.md)

**Application:** Is GSAP + no-code platform integration trending? Is minimalism vs. maximalism the pattern?

**Dutch Agencies (MediaMonks, Build in Amsterdam) Pattern:**
> *"They often do slick product showcase animations: subtle parallax, smooth carousels, etc. Often they combine GSAP with three.js (for 3D models of products). Pattern: combining 3D model animations (which can be tweened via GSAP) with ScrollTrigger for reveal sequences."*
(Source: 32-75-notable-agencies-patterns.md)

**Application:** Is product showcase animation trending? Is GSAP + Three.js becoming standard for e-commerce?

---

**2. Trend Context (2023-2025):**

**Scroll-Driven Animation Evolution:**
> *"Use of Scroll-driven animations has only increased -- thanks to ScrollTrigger making it easier. Many sites with high engagement use scroll narratives."*
(Source: 32-75-notable-agencies-patterns.md)

**Application:** Validate from WebSearch - is scroll-driven animation still rising or peaking? What's new in scroll patterns?

**SVG & Canvas Micro-Animations:**
> *"SVG and Canvas micro-animations: like animated logos, cursor effects (e.g., a custom cursor trail that is done via GSAP quickSetter to smoothly interpolate cursor movement)."*
(Source: 32-75-notable-agencies-patterns.md)

**Application:** Are micro-animations trending in 2024-2025? Which types (logos, cursors, loaders)?

**MatchMedia Usage:**
> *"MatchMedia usage: because of the multitude of device sizes, best sites tailor animations per breakpoint. E.g., heavy desktop animations toned down on mobile. We see more of that explicit handling."*
(Source: 32-75-notable-agencies-patterns.md)

**Application:** Is responsive animation design becoming standard? Are sites using GSAP MatchMedia more?

**License Change Impact:**
> *"License change: GSAP's free plugins means even more widespread adoption in award sites (previously some might avoid ScrollTrigger due to license, now no barrier). That suggests new sites might incorporate Flip and ScrollSmoother more, since 2024 onwards it's free."*
(Source: 32-75-notable-agencies-patterns.md)

**Application:** Has FREE plugin availability changed 2024-2025 trends? Are Flip, ScrollSmoother, MorphSVG usage increasing?

---

**3. Quality Framework:**

**Common Thread Quote:**
> *"In essence, analyzing these cases and studios, we identify a common thread: systematic use of GSAP's tools (timeline, scroll, plugins) combined with creative storytelling."*
(Source: 32-75-notable-agencies-patterns.md)

**Quality Markers from This Framework:**
- ✅ Systematic use (not random effects)
- ✅ Timeline organization (modular, maintainable)
- ✅ Scroll linking (user-controlled pacing)
- ✅ Plugin leverage (using right tools)
- ✅ Creative storytelling (not decoration)

**Application:** For each 2024-2025 trend discovered, assess:
- Is it systematic or random?
- Does it serve storytelling or just decoration?
- Is it using GSAP tools appropriately?

---

**4. Methodology Framework:**

**AI Guidance Quote:**
> *"AI should learn: Approach each animation challenge by thinking 'How would Active Theory or Locomotive do this?' -- likely modular timelines, scroll linking, heavy optimization, and always thinking of the user's perspective (control, pacing)."*
(Source: 32-75-notable-agencies-patterns.md)

**Framework Elements:**
- Modular timelines (composability)
- Scroll linking (user control)
- Heavy optimization (performance-first)
- User perspective (pacing, control, accessibility)

**Application:** Evaluate 2024-2025 trends against this framework:
- Are trends modular or monolithic?
- Do trends give user control or force pacing?
- Are trends performance-optimized?

---

**DEEP-RESEARCH FRAMEWORK APPLICATION:**

Present how Section 7.5 framework applies to WebSearch findings:

**Agency Pattern Validation:**
- Which agencies are referenced in 2024-2025 trends?
- Are established patterns (Active Theory WebGL, Resn playful, Dutch product showcases) still dominant?
- Or are NEW agencies emerging with different patterns?

**Trend Evolution Validation:**
- ScrollTrigger adoption: Still rising or saturated?
- Free plugin impact: Is Flip/ScrollSmoother/MorphSVG usage exploding?
- MatchMedia: Is responsive animation design standard now?

**Quality Marker Application:**
- How many 2024-2025 trends show "systematic use + creative storytelling"?
- How many are just decorative effects?
- What's the quality distribution?

**Innovation Level Assessment:**
- Which trends are refinements of established agency patterns?
- Which trends are genuinely NEW (not seen in Section 7.5 context)?
- Which trends are just rebranded older patterns?

### 3.4: Identify Innovation Level (Research-Backed Assessment)

**From Deep-Research Section 7.5 + Archon comparison:**

**Innovation Level Classification:**

**Truly Innovative (Genuinely NEW):**
- Never seen before (not in Section 7.5 agency patterns)
- Not in Archon historical sources
- Represents breakthrough in approach
- Examples:
  - [Trend]: Why genuinely new ([explain innovation])
  - [Count] trends are truly innovative

**Refined Evolution (Improvement on Established Pattern):**
- Based on established agency pattern (Section 7.5)
- Found in Archon historical sources
- Improved implementation or visual refinement
- Examples:
  - [Trend]: Based on [established pattern] but refined with [innovation]
  - [Count] trends are refinements

**Rehashed (Rebranded Older Pattern):**
- Just repackaging of old pattern
- Found in Archon historical, no meaningful evolution
- Visual restyling but same technique
- Examples:
  - [Trend]: Actually just [old pattern from Archon] with new aesthetic
  - [Count] trends are rehashed

**Standard Practice (No Longer a "Trend"):**
- Was innovative (Section 7.5 mentions as trend)
- Now baseline expectation
- Found in most premium sites
- Examples:
  - [Pattern]: Was trendy in [year], now standard
  - [Count] patterns are now standard (not trends)

### 3.5: Apply Deep-Research Quality Framework

**From Section 7.5:**
> *"Systematic use of GSAP's tools (timeline, scroll, plugins) combined with creative storytelling."*

**Quality Assessment for Each Trend:**

**Premium Quality (Meets Framework):**
- ✅ Systematic use (not random effects)
- ✅ Creative storytelling (serves narrative)
- ✅ User perspective (control, pacing)
- ✅ Performance-optimized
- Examples:
  - [Trend]: Meets framework because [systematic + storytelling + optimization]
  - [Count] trends are premium quality

**Decorative Only (Doesn't Meet Framework):**
- ❌ Random effects (not systematic)
- ❌ Just decoration (no storytelling)
- ❌ No user control (forced pacing)
- ❌ Performance concerns
- Examples:
  - [Trend]: Decorative because [lacks framework elements]
  - [Count] trends are decorative
