<step n="1" goal="Context Gathering">
<action>Greet {user_name} in {communication_language}</action>
<action>All written outputs must use {communication_language}</action>
<action>Introduce the creative ideation workflow with film director energy</action>

**"Let's create something exceptional. Tell me about your animation needs."**

<step n="2" goal="Multi-Source Research">
<critical>This is where we leverage THREE MCP servers for comprehensive research</critical>

<action>Execute multi-source research using MCP integrations</action>

**Research Protocol (Execute in parallel where possible):**

**1. Perplexity Research (Premium Examples)**
<action>Use perplexity_research tool with these queries:</action>
- "award-winning {{component_context}} animations 2024-2025 Awwwards FWA"
- "cutting-edge GSAP animation techniques 2025"
- "premium web animation trends design studios"
- "interactive animation examples {{industry_if_known}}"

**2. Archon MCP (GSAP Technical Knowledge)**
<action>Use rag_search_knowledge_base and rag_search_code_examples:</action>
- Search for GSAP showcase examples related to {{component_context}}
- Find advanced GSAP technique documentation
- Discover plugin ecosystem capabilities (ScrollTrigger, MorphSVG, SplitText)
- Locate performance best practices

**3. Context7 (Latest GSAP APIs)**
<action>Use get-library-docs:</action>
- Fetch latest GSAP version capabilities
- Identify new plugins and features in current release
- Check API compatibility and requirements

<critical>Document ALL sources with citations (URLs, examples, agencies)</critical>

<template-output>perplexity_findings, archon_patterns, context7_api_info, research_citations</template-output>
</step>

<step n="3" goal="Trend Analysis & Synthesis">
<action>Analyze research findings to identify patterns</action>

**Analysis approach:**

1. **Identify cutting-edge vs overdone**
   - What's fresh and exciting in 2025?
   - What's become clichÃ© or tired?
   - What fits the brand personality?

2. **Assess technical feasibility**
   - Can current GSAP version achieve this?
   - What plugins are required?
   - Performance implications for 60fps target?

3. **Map to brand personality**
   - Playful â†’ physics, bouncy easing
   - Professional â†’ smooth, controlled, precise
   - Edgy â†’ unexpected, bold, dramatic
   - Minimal â†’ subtle, elegant, refined

4. **Consider constraints**
   - Performance budget â†’ simpler or optimized
   - Timeline â†’ proven patterns vs experimental
   - Accessibility â†’ reduced-motion alternatives

<action>Synthesize findings into concept themes</action>

<template-output>trend_analysis, technical_feasibility, brand_mapping</template-output>
</step>

<step n="4" goal="Concept Generation">
<critical>Generate 3-5 DISTINCT premium concepts</critical>

<action>Create concepts based on research synthesis</action>

**For EACH concept, provide ALL 10 attributes:**

1. **Name** - Evocative, memorable title (e.g., "Cinematic Depth Parallax")
2. **Visual Description** - How it looks and feels (sensory language, cinematic references)
3. **Technical Approach** - GSAP features/plugins required, implementation strategy
4. **Wow Factor** - What makes this premium/unique/memorable
5. **User Experience** - How users perceive and interact with it
6. **Complexity Level** - Simple / Medium / High (implementation effort)
7. **Performance Impact** - Expected FPS, bundle size considerations
8. **Inspiration Sources** - Real-world examples with citations from research
9. **Best Suited For** - When this concept shines vs when to avoid it
10. **Accessibility Notes** - How to maintain usability (prefers-reduced-motion support)

**Concept Diversity Guidelines:**
- Mix complexity levels (at least one Medium, one Medium-High or High)
- Different technical approaches (timeline, ScrollTrigger, physics, morphing, etc.)
- Variety in visual styles (subtle, dramatic, playful, cinematic)
- At least one concept should be cutting-edge (2024-2025 trends)

<action>For comparison table in template, extract key attributes from first 3 concepts:</action>
- Concept 1: name, complexity, performance, wow factor rating, best suited for
- Concept 2: name, complexity, performance, wow factor rating, best suited for

## MCP Tool Usage Notes

**Parallel Execution:**
- Perplexity, Archon, and Context7 searches can run simultaneously
- Maximize research speed by parallel MCP calls

**Error Handling:**
- If MCP unavailable: Warn user, continue with available sources
- Single retry on timeout, then graceful degradation
- Document which sources were used in final output

**Query Optimization:**
- Keep queries SHORT (2-5 keywords)
- Focus on technical terms and specific features
- Avoid long sentences

## Quality Standards

**Concept Quality:**
- Each concept must be AMBITIOUS, not safe
- Clear wow factor articulated
- Backed by research citations
- Technically feasible with current GSAP

**Research Quality:**
- Multiple sources consulted (all 3 MCPs minimum)
- Prioritize 2024-2025 examples
- Beyond basic tutorials - find premium patterns
- Cite sources with URLs

**Presentation Quality:**
- Decision-friendly format
- Clear tradeoffs explained
- Professional yet engaging tone
- Film director energy throughout

## Success Metrics

- âœ… 80%+ user selects a concept (not requests restart)
- âœ… Concepts feel premium, not generic
- âœ… Research citations provided
- âœ… Mix of complexity levels
- âœ… Technical approaches are ambitious

## Integration

**Feeds Into:**
