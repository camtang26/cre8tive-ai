# Research GSAP Pattern Workflow

## Overview

Deep research into specific GSAP techniques by systematically querying 89 Archon MCP sources. This workflow transforms "How do I implement X?" into comprehensive research reports with code examples, best practices, and 2025 standards validation.

## When to Use

✅ Need to understand a specific GSAP technique
✅ Before implementing unfamiliar patterns
✅ Want research-backed implementation approach
✅ Learning advanced GSAP features

❌ Already know how to implement (use VFX Artist)
❌ Simple tweens (documentation sufficient)

## Usage

```bash
/bmad:gsap-excellence:agents:gsap-cinematographer
*research
```

**You'll be asked:**
- Specific GSAP pattern to research
- Framework (React, Next.js, Vanilla)
- Complexity level interest

**Output:** Research report with code examples, citations, best practices

## Key Features

- **89-Source Systematic Query** - All Archon MCP sources
- **Code Examples** - Production-ready implementations
- **Best Practices** - 2025 GSAP standards
- **Pitfall Warnings** - Common mistakes to avoid
- **Framework-Specific** - React/Next.js/Vue guidance

## Estimated Duration: 10-15 minutes
