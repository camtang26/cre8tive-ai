# Refine Timing Workflow

## Overview

Polish animation timing, easing curves, and choreography to achieve natural, premium-feeling motion. Focuses on the "feel" of animation rather than technical correctness.

## When to Use

✅ Animation works but feels off
✅ Timing needs polish
✅ Easing curves too linear/mechanical
✅ Elements not coordinated well

❌ Animation has bugs (debug-animation first)
❌ Performance issues (optimize-performance)

## Usage

```bash
/bmad:gsap-excellence:agents:gsap-editor
*refine
```

**You'll be asked:**
- What feels off
- Current timing values
- Desired feel (snappy, smooth, elastic, etc.)

**Output:** Refined animation with natural motion

## What Gets Refined

### Timing
- Duration optimization
- Delay coordination
- Stagger timing
- Overlap vs gap

### Easing
- Custom easing curves
- Ease-in vs ease-out
- Elastic, bounce, back effects
- Natural vs mechanical feel

### Choreography
- Element coordination
- Entrance/exit timing
- Visual hierarchy
- Attention direction

## Motion Principles Applied

- **Anticipation** - Build expectation
- **Follow-through** - Natural momentum
- **Staging** - Direct attention
- **Timing** - Convey weight and character
- **Exaggeration** - Add personality

## Estimated Duration: 15-25 minutes
