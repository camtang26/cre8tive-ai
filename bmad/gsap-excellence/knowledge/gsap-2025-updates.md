## How This Changes Our Recommendations

### OLD Mindset (Pre-3.13):
- ❌ "Let's use a simpler approach to avoid premium plugins"
- ❌ "ScrollTrigger scrub instead of ScrollSmoother (costs $99)"
- ❌ "CSS transitions for text instead of SplitText (costs $99)"
- ❌ "Manual path animation instead of MotionPath (costs $99)"

### NEW Mindset (GSAP 3.13+):
- ✅ "Premium plugins are FREE - use them liberally!"
- ✅ "Default to ScrollSmoother for smooth scroll experiences"
- ✅ "Use SplitText for ANY text animation needs"
- ✅ "MotionPath is now the standard for curved animations"
- ✅ "Push for BETTER, not just 'good enough'"

## Impact on Each Agent Role

### Director (gsap-director)
- **Before:** Avoid premium plugins in creative vision
- **After:** ACTIVELY suggest premium plugins in concepts
- **Example:** "Let's use ScrollSmoother + MorphSVG for the hero reveal"

### Cinematographer (gsap-cinematographer)
- **Before:** Research basic alternatives to premium plugins
- **After:** Research premium plugin best practices FIRST
- **Example:** Search "SplitText advanced techniques" not "CSS text animation"

### VFX Artist (gsap-vfx)
- **Before:** Implement workarounds to avoid premium costs
- **After:** Implement with premium plugins as the default
- **Example:** Use MorphSVG for icon states, not CSS transform hacks

### Editor (gsap-editor)
- **Before:** Accept "good enough" animations due to cost
- **After:** Push for premium polish using free premium plugins
- **Example:** "Use ScrollSmoother for buttery smoothness, not basic scrub"

### Tech Director (gsap-tech-director)
- **Before:** Warn about premium plugin bundle size
- **After:** Validate premium plugin usage as best practice
- **Example:** ScrollSmoother is now standard, not a luxury

## Version Requirement

**CRITICAL:** All recommendations must require GSAP 3.13.0+ to access free premium plugins.

**Package.json Example:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "gsap": "^3.13.0"
  }
}
```

**Installation Command:**
```bash
npm install gsap@^3.13.0
```

## Communication Guidelines

When suggesting premium plugins, ALWAYS mention they're free in 3.13+:

### Good Examples:
- ✅ "Use ScrollSmoother (FREE in GSAP 3.13+) for silky-smooth scrolling"
- ✅ "Implement with SplitText (now FREE!) for character-by-character reveals"
- ✅ "MotionPath (FREE in 3.13+) is perfect for curved animations"

### Bad Examples:
- ❌ "Use ScrollSmoother" (doesn't mention it's free now - user may think it costs money)
- ❌ "Try SplitText if budget allows" (WRONG - it's FREE!)
- ❌ "Premium plugins are too expensive" (OUTDATED knowledge!)
