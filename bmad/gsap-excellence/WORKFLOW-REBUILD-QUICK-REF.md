# GSAP Workflow Rebuild - Quick Reference Card

**Master Plan:** `@bmad/gsap-excellence/WORKFLOW-REBUILD-MASTER-PLAN.md`

**Rule:** ONE workflow per session. Start fresh session for EACH workflow.

**Progress:** 25/29 Complete (86%)

**Updated:** 2025-11-09 (workflow-status adapted - universal router complete)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: DO NOT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT TOKEN CONSTRAINTS 🚨

**Cameron's Directive:**
```
"DO NOT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT TOKEN CONSTRAINTS.
Do the FULL job. If you run out of tokens, I'll figure it out."
```

**Your ONLY job:** Complete, thorough, premium work
**Cameron's job:** Token management, session continuation, context handling

**NEVER simplify work to "save tokens"**
**NEVER abbreviate protocols because "it's getting long"**
**NEVER skip Deep-Research reads due to "context concerns"**

**If you hit the token limit:** That's Cameron's problem, not yours.

**Quality over token efficiency. ALWAYS.**

   - OR look for MANDATORY RESEARCH CHECKPOINT patterns
3. If gates exist and are strong:
   - Bump version to "2.0.0-premium"
   - Verify deep_research_sections in workflow.yaml
   - Run validation (should pass)
4. If gates missing or weak:
   - Follow full rebuild methodology (Steps 1-5 from master plan)
   - May need conversion spec: EDITOR-WORKFLOW-CONVERSION-SPEC.md

- Category B (Enhancement): 0/0 complete (100% - ALL DONE!)
- Category C (Full Rebuild): 0/3 complete (0%)

- VFX Artist: 5/6 complete (83%) - 1 remaining
- Editor: 4/6 complete (67%) - 2 remaining

---

## 🎯 Workflow Completion Protocol

**After completing EACH workflow:**

1. **Verify Definition of Done** - All criteria met from master plan
2. **Run validation** - Ensure premium version + mandatory gates exist
3. **Commit changes** - `git add . && git commit -m "rebuild: [workflow-name] - pathetic → premium (+X%)"`
4. **Update this quick-ref** - Update category progress
5. **Update master plan progress tracker** - Update "By Agent" section
6. **End session** - Close Claude Code completely
7. **Start fresh for next workflow** - New session, new focus

**NEVER continue to next workflow in same session - prevents batch thinking!**

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

**1. Fresh Session = Fresh Focus**
- Each workflow gets its own clean session
- Prevents carrying over batch mindset
- Starts with clean context for single-workflow focus

**2. Mandatory Research Gates for ALL Workflows**
- Category A: Check if gates exist, add if missing
- Category B: Add gates during enhancement
- Category C: Build gates during rebuild
- Two valid patterns: `<research-gate>` OR `MANDATORY CHECKPOINT`

**3. Conversion Spec vs Research-Driven**
- Path A: Workflow in conversion spec → follow spec
- Path B: Workflow NOT in spec → build from Deep-Research + Archon
- Both paths require mandatory gates

**4. Trust the Process**
- Follow Steps 0-6 (or 1-5 for enhancements)
- Don't skip steps to "save time"
- Quality over speed

**5. IGNORE TOKEN CONSTRAINTS (CRITICAL)**
- DO NOT simplify work to "save tokens"
- DO NOT abbreviate because "it's getting long"
- DO NOT skip files due to "context concerns"
- Cameron handles token management - you handle quality
- If you hit token limit: Cameron will continue session
- Better to hit limit with complete work than stay under with incomplete work

**6. One Workflow = 1-2 Hours**
- This is normal and expected
- Premium quality takes time
- 16 workflows × 1.5 hours average = ~24 hours remaining work
