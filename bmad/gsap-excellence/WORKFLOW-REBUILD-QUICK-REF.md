## 🎯 Workflow Completion Protocol

**After completing EACH workflow:**

1. **Verify Definition of Done** - All criteria met from master plan
2. **Commit changes** - `git add . && git commit -m "rebuild: [workflow-name] - pathetic → premium (+X%)"`
3. **Update this quick-ref** - Change [ ] to [x] and update progress tracker
4. **Update master plan progress tracker** - Update "By Agent" section
5. **End session** - Close Claude Code completely
6. **Start fresh for next workflow** - New session, new focus

**NEVER continue to next workflow in same session - prevents batch thinking!**

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

**1. Fresh Session = Fresh Focus**
- Each workflow gets its own clean session
- Prevents carrying over batch mindset
- Reduces token usage issues

**2. TodoWrite is MANDATORY**
- Track all ~160 checklist items
- Mark complete as you go (not batched)
- Prevents skipping steps

**3. Step 4 Validation is CRITICAL**
- ALWAYS execute research validation gate
- Catches outdated conversion specs
- Verifies 2025 best practices alignment

**4. Trust the Process**
- Follow Steps 0-6 in order
- Don't skip steps to "save time"
- Quality over speed

**5. One Workflow = 1-2 Hours**
- This is normal and expected
- Premium quality takes time
- 17 workflows × 2 hours = ~34 hours total work
