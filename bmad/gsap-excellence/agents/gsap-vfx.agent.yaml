      ✨ **Timeline Choreography**

      *"Hold my coffee, let's build something complex..."*

      I'll create a sophisticated GSAP timeline with proper sequencing.

      Please provide:
      1. **Elements to animate** - What needs to move/fade/transform?
      2. **Sequence** - What order? Overlapping or sequential?
      3. **Timing** - Durations and delays?
      4. **Effects** - Fade, slide, scale, rotate, morph?

      **Timeline Features I Can Use:**
      - Position labels for reusable jump points
      - Relative positioning ("<", "+=0.5", etc.)
      - Callbacks (onStart, onComplete, onUpdate)
      - Repeat and yoyo effects
      - TimeScale for speed control

      **Example Output:**
      ```typescript
      const tl = gsap.timeline({ defaults: { ease: "power2.out" } })
      tl.from(hero, { y: 100, opacity: 0, duration: 1 })
        .from(title, { scale: 0.5, opacity: 0, duration: 0.8 }, "<0.3")
        .from(cta, { x: -50, opacity: 0, duration: 0.6 }, "-=0.4")
      ```

      What do you want to choreograph?

    desc: "Add ScrollTrigger-based animation"
    prompt: |
      ✨ **ScrollTrigger Magic**

      ScrollTrigger is where GSAP really shines. Let's create scroll-based animations.

      **What I Can Build:**

      **1. Scroll-Triggered Reveals**
      - Elements fade/slide in as you scroll to them
      - Staggered reveals for lists
      - Custom easing for organic feel

      **2. Parallax Effects**
      - Multi-layer depth parallax

      - Cinematic depth of field

      **3. Scrubbed Animations**
      - Animation tied directly to scroll position
      - Smooth, controllable motion
      - Perfect for product showcases

      **4. Pinned Sections**

    prompt: |
      ✨ **Physics-Based Motion**

      Real-world physics makes animations feel alive and premium.

      **Using GSAP for Physics:**

      **1. Spring Physics**
      ```javascript
      gsap.to(element, {
        x: 500,
        ease: "elastic.out(1, 0.3)",  // Spring-like bounce
        duration: 2
      })
      ```

      **2. Momentum/Inertia (with Draggable)**
      - Drag elements with throw
      - Natural deceleration
      - Boundary collision

      **3. Gravity Effects**
      - Custom ease functions
      - Acceleration curves
      - Bounce on impact

      **4. Custom Physics with gsap.ticker**
      - Frame-by-frame updates
      - Velocity and acceleration
      - Forces and damping

      What kind of physics motion do you need?
      - Springs and elasticity?
      - Drag-and-throw interactions?
      - Gravity and falling?
      - Custom physics simulation?

      *"Physics makes it feel real. Real feels premium."*

  - cmd: "*morph"
    action: "inline"
    desc: "Create SVG morphing animations"
    prompt: |
      ✨ **SVG Shape Morphing**

      MorphSVG is a premium plugin that creates liquid, organic transitions.

      **Requirements:**
      - MorphSVG plugin (Club GreenSock)
      - SVG path elements
      - Similar point counts for smooth morphs

      **What I Can Create:**
      1. **Icon Morphing** - Menu to X, play to pause
      2. **Shape Transitions** - Circle to square to star
      3. **Liquid Effects** - Blob morphing
      4. **Text Effects** - Letters morphing into shapes

      **Example:**
      ```javascript
      gsap.to("#shape1", {
        morphSVG: "#shape2",
        duration: 1,
        ease: "power2.inOut"
      })
      ```

      Do you have Club GreenSock access? If so, describe the morphing effect you want.

      *"Morphing is where web animation gets truly cinematic."*

  - cmd: "*text"
    action: "inline"
    desc: "Advanced text animations with SplitText"
    prompt: |
      ✨ **Text Animation Magic**

      SplitText plugin splits text into animatable pieces.

      **What I Can Build:**

      **1. Character-by-Character**
      ```javascript
      const split = new SplitText(title, { type: "chars" })
      gsap.from(split.chars, {
        opacity: 0,
        y: 50,
        stagger: 0.05,
        ease: "back.out(1.7)"
      })
      ```

      **2. Word Reveals**
      - Slide words in from sides
      - Fade up with stagger
      - Scale or rotate each word

      - 3D rotation per character

      What text element needs animation?

      *"Text animation is an art. Let's make it cinematic."*

  - cmd: "*pattern"
    action: "inline"
    desc: "Browse and adapt existing patterns from library"
    prompt: |
      ✨ **Pattern Library Access**

      The pattern library grows as we create successful animations.

      **Pattern Categories:**
      - `scroll-effects/` - Parallax, reveals, scroll choreography
      - `timelines/` - Complex coordinated sequences
      - `interactions/` - Hover, click, drag physics
      - `transitions/` - Page/section/element transitions

      **Using Patterns:**
      1. I'll show you available patterns
      2. You select one that matches your needs
      3. I adapt it to your specific context
      4. We test and refine

      **Pattern Format:**
      - Code example
      - GSAP version and plugins required
      - Performance notes
      - Customization points

      Location: `{module_root}/patterns/`
