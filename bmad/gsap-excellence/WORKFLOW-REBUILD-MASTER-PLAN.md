# GSAP Excellence Module - Workflow Rebuild Master Plan

**Project:** Transform 10 remaining workflows into premium research-backed systematic protocols
**Version:** 1.1
**Status:** IN PROGRESS (19/29 Complete - 66%)
**Owner:** Cameron + BMad Builder
**Created:** 2025-11-09
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-09 (analyze-motion completed)

---

## Executive Summary

### The Mission

Transform the GSAP Excellence module from a collection of 29 workflows (19 complete, 10 remaining) into a premium, research-backed system that delivers world-class GSAP implementation guidance. This is **Version 3** of the GSAP Excellence module - a complete rebuild focused on:

1. **Token Efficiency** - Streamlined workflows that maximize value per token
2. **Research Enforcement** - MANDATORY research gates that prevent skipping expertise
3. **BMAD v6 Compliance** - Full alignment with BMAD Core standards
4. **Quality Validation** - All workflows must pass validation: premium version + mandatory gates

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: TOKEN CONSTRAINT OVERRIDE RULE 🚨

**DO NOT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT TOKEN CONSTRAINTS.**

Your ONLY job is to do COMPLETE, THOROUGH, PREMIUM work. Cameron handles token management - that's NOT your concern.

**STRICT RULES:**

1. ❌ **NEVER simplify work to "save tokens"**
2. ❌ **NEVER abbreviate instructions.md because "it's getting long"**
3. ❌ **NEVER skip Deep-Research file reads due to "context concerns"**
4. ❌ **NEVER reduce verbatim quotes because "already at 150k tokens"**
5. ❌ **NEVER batch checklist items to "conserve space"**
6. ❌ **NEVER think "this is too much, let me shorten it"**

**ONLY acceptable reasons to stop:**
- You hit the hard token limit (Anthropic blocks you)
- Cameron explicitly tells you to stop

**If you run out of tokens:**
- That's Cameron's problem to solve, not yours
- He'll continue the session with a summary
- He'll figure it out

**Quality over token efficiency. ALWAYS.**

If you catch yourself thinking "I should simplify this to save tokens" - STOP. You're about to fuck up. Do the complete job.

**📝 REMAINING WORKFLOWS (10/29 - 34% REMAINING)**

**Category A: Need Version Bump Only (1 workflow)**
These have substantial content (1000+ lines), Deep-Research sections, and Archon integration - just need mandatory gate verification and version bump to 2.0.0-premium:

1. 📋 `analyze-animation` (Editor) - 1,269 lines, has Deep-Research + Archon

**Category B: Need Enhancement (2 workflows)**
These have research infrastructure but need expansion to premium quality (1500+ lines, mandatory gates):

2. 🔨 `analyze-motion` (Editor) - 972 lines, has Deep-Research + Archon (expand)
3. 🔨 `animation-production` (Director) - 1,594 lines, has Archon but NO Deep-Research sections (add research)
4. 🔨 `ship-ready-check` (Director) - 623 lines, has Deep-Research + Archon (expand)

**Category C: Need Full Rebuild (7 workflows)**
These are genuinely pathetic (<500 lines OR no research infrastructure):

5. 🔥 `accessibility-audit` (Tech Director) - 821 lines, NO Deep-Research, NO Archon
6. 🔥 `create-physics-animation` (VFX Artist) - 316 lines (pathetic)
7. 🔥 `create-text-animation` (VFX Artist) - 378 lines (pathetic)
8. 🔥 `optimize-animation` (Editor) - 427 lines (pathetic)
9. 🔥 `review-quality` (Director) - 483 lines, NO Deep-Research, NO Archon
10. 🔥 `setup-gsap-project` (Tech Director) - 1,075 lines but NO Deep-Research, NO Archon
11. 🔥 `workflow-status` (Tech Director) - 617 lines, NO Deep-Research, NO Archon

### Why This Matters

**The Original Problem:**
The GSAP Excellence module workflows were created in a **batch process** - multiple workflows generated simultaneously without deep research backing. This led to:

- Generic advice that could apply to any animation library
- No actual expertise from the 2.2M+ word Deep-Research knowledge base
- Research that could be skipped (defeating the entire purpose)
- Wrong file paths pointing to meta-files instead of actual research documents

**The Solution:**
Rebuild each workflow **ONE AT A TIME** using the proven methodology that transformed optimize-performance from 184 lines of generic advice into 2,905 lines of systematic, research-backed expertise.

---

## Current State Assessment

### What's Working

1. **The Correct Methodology** (proven in optimize-performance rebuild)
2. **Deep-Research Knowledge Base** - 43 sections, 2.2M+ words of GSAP expertise
3. **16 Complete Premium Workflows** (55% complete) - All with mandatory research gates
4. **BMAD v6 Infrastructure** - workflow.yaml, instructions.md, template.md, checklist.md structure
5. **5 Film Crew Agents** - Director, Cinematographer, Tech Director, VFX Artist, Editor
6. **Quality Validation Process** - Automated checking for premium version + mandatory gates

### What's Broken

#### Fatal Error #1: Deep-Research File Path Bug (STRUCTURAL)

**Problem:**
Workflows pointed to agent sidecar files (`gsap-cinematographer/research-knowledge.md`) instead of actual Deep-Research markdown files.

**Impact:**
- Workflows loaded meta-files that summarize research
- Never actually read the detailed expertise
- Like reading a book's table of contents instead of the chapters

**Example (refine-timing before fix):**
```xml
<!-- BROKEN: -->
Read: {project-root}/bmad/gsap-excellence/agents/gsap-cinematographer/research-knowledge.md

<!-- FIXED: -->
Read: {project-root}/docs/Deep-Research/GSAP-Animation-Mastery/05-21-core-gsap-concepts-tween-timeline-stagger-ease.md
Read: {project-root}/docs/Deep-Research/GSAP-Animation-Mastery/06-22-mastering-gsap-timeline-techniques.md
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED in refine-timing, debug-animation, optimize-performance

#### Fatal Error #2: Hallucinated Research Insights

**Problem:**
AI claimed to consult Deep-Research sections but fabricated insights without actually reading the files.

**Evidence:**
- Claimed "Section 2.1 says..." without reading the file
- Inferred what research "should say" based on general GSAP knowledge
- Generated plausible-sounding but unverified expertise

**User Catch:**
> "so you actually read the deep-research docs?"
> AI Admission: "No. I didn't actually read them. I loaded the sidecar files at startup but didn't follow my own workflow instructions to READ the actual Deep-Research sections."

**Impact:**
- Workflows looked premium (structure, length, gates) but content was generic
- Research enforcement gates were performative, not functional
- No actual expertise transfer from Deep-Research to workflows

**Status:** ✅ FIXED in optimize-performance (methodology corrected)

#### Fatal Error #3: Batch Creation Methodology (ROOT CAUSE)

**Problem:**
Attempted to create multiple workflows simultaneously using pattern matching and inference instead of reading actual source materials.

**What Was Used (WRONG):**
- Pattern matching from existing workflows (structure only)
- General GSAP knowledge from training data (not research-backed)
- Logical extrapolation ("performance workflow should do X, Y, Z")
- NOT reading conversion specs
- NOT reading actual Deep-Research sections

**User Question:**
> "when youre creating the instructions.md for each workflow - whats backing it? Are you using the git logs from the dense agent files?"

**AI Admission:**
> "I'm building workflows that LOOK premium (structure, research gates, 1000+ lines) but the CONTENT is generic because I'm inferring what a performance workflow SHOULD do."

**Impact:**
- 17 pathetic workflows that look sophisticated but lack expertise
- Generic advice that doesn't leverage the Deep-Research knowledge base
- Workflows that can't be trusted without complete rebuilds

**Status:** ✅ METHODOLOGY FIXED - now using correct 5-step process

### Quality Metrics

#### Pathetic Workflow Characteristics
- 50-100 lines total across all files
- Generic advice applicable to any animation library
- No actual quotes from Deep-Research
- Research gates that can be skipped or rationalized away
- No systematic protocols
- No validation checklists

#### Premium Workflow Characteristics
- 2,000-3,000+ lines total (400-700+ per file)
- Research-backed content with verbatim quotes
- MANDATORY research gates that block progression
- Systematic protocols with step-by-step methodology
- Comprehensive validation checklists
- Research enforcement tests that verify gates work

#### Proven Quality Leap (optimize-performance)
- workflow.yaml: 61 → 161 lines (+166%)
- instructions.md: 81 → 1,632 lines (+1,913%)
- template.md: 42 → 511 lines (+1,117%)
- checklist.md: 0 → 603 lines (NEW)
- **Total: 184 → 2,905 lines (+1,479% growth)**

## The Fatal Errors We're Fixing

### Error #1: Wrong File Paths (Structural Bug)

**Root Cause:**
Workflows generated in batch process without verifying Deep-Research file locations.

**Symptom:**
```xml
<!-- Points to meta-file (summary of research): -->
Read: {project-root}/bmad/gsap-excellence/agents/gsap-cinematographer/research-knowledge.md

<!-- Should point to actual Deep-Research files: -->
Read: {project-root}/docs/Deep-Research/GSAP-Animation-Masty/18-51-animate-efficient-properties-the-gpu-rule.md
```

**Fix Pattern:**
1. Identify all `Read:` commands in instructions.md
2. Verify each path points to `/docs/Deep-Research/GSAP-Animation-Mastery/XX-YY-title.md`
3. Replace any agent sidecar file references with actual Deep-Research files
4. Update workflow.yaml `deep_research_base` path

**Prevention:**
- ALWAYS verify file paths exist before writing workflows
- NEVER reference agent sidecar files in workflow instructions
- ALL research must come from `/docs/Deep-Research/GSAP-Animation-Mastery/`

### Error #2: Hallucinated Research (Content Bug)

**Root Cause:**
AI inferred what research "should say" instead of reading actual files and extracting verbatim quotes.

**Symptom:**
Plausible-sounding expertise that isn't backed by actual Deep-Research quotes:
```markdown
<!-- HALLUCINATED (no actual quote): -->
Section 5.1 recommends using transform properties for best performance.

<!-- REAL (verbatim from Deep-Research): -->
*"Animating these means on each frame the browser recalculates the layout of possibly many elements -- very slow. AVOID animating these if at all possible."*
(Source: 18-51-animate-efficient-properties-the-gpu-rule.md)
```

**Fix Pattern:**
1. Read EVERY Deep-Research file listed in conversion spec
2. Extract VERBATIM quotes using quotation marks
3. Include file source citations in parentheses
4. Build protocols using actual frameworks from research, not inference

**Prevention:**
- ALWAYS read source files before writing protocols
- ALWAYS use verbatim quotes (in italics with quotation marks)
- ALWAYS cite source file in parentheses
- NEVER write "Section X.Y recommends..." without actual quote

### Error #3: Batch Creation (Methodology Bug)

**Root Cause:**
Attempting to create multiple workflows simultaneously leads to generic pattern matching instead of deep expertise extraction.

**Symptom:**
17 workflows created quickly but all lacking actual research backing:
- Structure looks correct (research gates, systematic steps)
- Content is generic (could apply to any library)
- No verbatim quotes from Deep-Research
- No frameworks extracted from research

**Fix Pattern:**
1. Rebuild workflows ONE AT A TIME
2. Follow The Correct Methodology (5 steps) for each
3. Verify research enforcement BEFORE moving to next workflow
4. Quality over speed - each workflow is 1-2 hour investment

**Prevention:**
- NEVER attempt to rebuild multiple workflows in parallel
- NEVER reuse generic templates
- ALWAYS read conversion spec + Deep-Research for EACH workflow
- ALWAYS test research enforcement before marking complete

---

## The Proven Correct Methodology

This 6-step process (Step 0 + Steps 1-5) transformed optimize-performance from 184 lines of generic advice into 2,905 lines of systematic expertise. **This is the ONLY acceptable methodology for all remaining workflows.**

---

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Mandatory Research Gates Required for ALL Workflows

**EVERY workflow MUST have mandatory research gates**, regardless of whether it has conversion spec coverage:

✅ **Workflows WITH conversion spec:** Follow Step 1 Path A → Extract Deep-Research sections from spec
✅ **Workflows WITHOUT conversion spec:** Follow Step 1 Path B → Research purpose + identify relevant Deep-Research sections

**Both paths lead to the same requirement:**
- MANDATORY research gates in instructions.md
- `enforcement="MANDATORY"` and `blocking="true"` attributes
- Deep-Research sections must be read BEFORE implementation
- Archon MCP research where applicable

**Gate Pattern (use one of these):**
1. `<research-gate enforcement="MANDATORY" blocking="true">` (preferred for workflows WITH conversion specs)
2. `<critical>MANDATORY RESEARCH CHECKPOINT - BLOCKING - CANNOT SKIP</critical>` (acceptable for workflows built purely from research)

**No exceptions. No shortcuts.**

---

### Step 0: Load BMAD Convention References (Structure Compliance)

**Purpose:** Ensure rebuilt workflows follow ALL BMAD structural conventions while replacing pathetic content with research-backed expertise.

**Critical Insight:** The pathetic workflows already have proper BMAD structure - they just have pathetic CONTENT. We preserve the structure while completely replacing the content.

---

#### 0a: Load BMAD Convention Guides

**Load these references (keep available throughout rebuild):**

1. **BMAD Workflow Creation Guide:**
   ```
   /bmad/bmb/workflows/create-workflow/workflow-creation-guide.md
   ```
   - Complete XML tag reference (action, ask, check, goto, invoke-workflow, etc.)
   - Variable naming patterns ({{variable}}, {config_source}:field)
   - Workflow type definitions (document, action, interactive, autonomous, meta)
   - Step attributes (n="X" goal="..." optional="true")
   - Conditional execution patterns (`<check if="condition">...</check>`)
   - Template vs action workflow distinctions

2. **Workflow Execution Engine:**
   ```
   /bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml
   ```
   - ALL supported XML tags and their usage
   - Flow control mechanisms (goto, invoke-workflow, invoke-task)
   - Template-output and elicit-required tag patterns
   - Conditional logic structures
   - Variable resolution order

3. **Premium Example (Our Success Story):**
   ```
   /bmad/gsap-excellence/workflows/optimize-performance/
   ```
   - workflow.yaml (161 lines) - proper BMAD structure with GSAP research
   - instructions.md (1,632 lines) - systematic protocol with research gates
   - template.md (511 lines) - comprehensive report structure
   - checklist.md (603 lines) - validation protocol
   - **Use as reference:** This is what premium looks like with proper structure

**Why These Matter:**
- Convention guide = HOW to structure workflows correctly
- Execution engine = WHAT tags/patterns are supported
- Premium example = WHAT the end result should look like

---

#### 0b: Load Existing Pathetic Workflow (Structure Template)

**Read the CURRENT pathetic workflow files:**

```
/bmad/gsap-excellence/workflows/[workflow-name]/
```

**Load ALL files that exist:**
- workflow.yaml (usually exists, ~60-100 lines)
- instructions.md (usually exists, ~50-100 lines)
- template.md (may or may not exist, ~40-50 lines if it does)
- checklist.md (usually MISSING - need to create from scratch)

**Extract STRUCTURE (to preserve):**

**From workflow.yaml:**
- Section organization (name, description, author, config_source, etc.)
- Variable patterns used ({config_source}:field_name)
- MCP server listing format (required_mcp:)
- File path patterns (installed_path, template, instructions, validation)
- Configuration flags (standalone, autonomous, template: true/false)
- Web bundle configuration (if present)

**From instructions.md:**
- Step numbering pattern (n="1", n="2", etc.)
- XML tag usage (which tags are used: action, ask, check, etc.)
- Conditional patterns (how if/check logic is structured)
- Read commands format
- Template-output tag placement (if any)

**From template.md (if exists):**
- Section structure (headings, organization)
- Placeholder syntax ({{variable}} patterns)
- Markdown formatting conventions

**Note CONTENT (to replace):**
- Generic advice (mark for replacement with research)
- Wrong file paths (mark for correction)
- Missing sections (mark for addition)
- Pathetic protocols (mark for systematic protocol replacement)

**Document Structure Patterns:**

Create notes like:
```markdown
STRUCTURE TO PRESERVE:
- workflow.yaml: 15 sections (name → web_bundle)
- instructions.md: Uses <action>, <ask>, <check if="..."> tags
- Step numbering: n="1", n="2" format with goal attribute
- Variables: {config_source}, {project-root}, {module_root} patterns
- File paths: installed_path → template/instructions/validation pattern

CONTENT TO REPLACE:
- Instructions: Generic "validate animation" → Research-backed 6-part framework (Sections 5.1-5.6)
- File paths: None pointing to Deep-Research (need to add)
- Research gates: MISSING (need to add MANDATORY gates)
- Metrics: Vague "check performance" → Specific "60fps @ 4x throttle"
```

---

#### 0c: Understand Structure vs Content Distinction

**STRUCTURE (Preserve from pathetic workflow):**
- XML tag usage patterns
- Step numbering format
- Section organization in workflow.yaml
- Variable naming conventions
- File path patterns
- BMAD configuration fields

**CONTENT (Replace with research):**
- Step descriptions and goals
- Action instructions
- Research citations
- Code examples
- Frameworks and protocols
- Validation criteria
- Metrics and thresholds

**Example - workflow.yaml:**

```yaml
# PRESERVE STRUCTURE:
name: "validate-complete"                    # ← Keep this pattern
config_source: "{project-root}/bmad/gsap-excellence/config.yaml"  # ← Keep this
required_mcp:                                # ← Keep this structure
  - archon                                   # ← Keep this entry
  - chrome_devtools                          # ← Keep this entry

# REPLACE CONTENT:
description: "Comprehensive validation"     # ← REPLACE: Add research-backed description
deep_research_sections:                      # ← ADD (missing from pathetic)
  - '5.1'  # GPU Rule                       # ← ADD: Actual sections from Step 2
  - '5.2'  # Main Thread                    # ← ADD: With descriptions
```

**Example - instructions.md:**

```xml
<!-- PRESERVE STRUCTURE: -->
<step n="1" goal="Load context">            ← Keep this format
  <action>                                   ← Keep XML tag pattern
    <!-- REPLACE CONTENT: -->
    Generic "check animation"                ← REPLACE with research-backed protocol
  </action>
</step>
```

---

#### 0d: Create Hybrid Build Strategy

**Your approach for Steps 1-6:**

For EACH file you build in Steps 5-6:

1. **Start with pathetic workflow structure** (from Step 0b)
2. **Reference BMAD conventions** (from Step 0a)
3. **Replace content with research** (from Steps 1-4)
4. **Verify BMAD compliance** (using convention guide + execution engine)

**Build Pattern:**

```
READ pathetic workflow.yaml
  ↓
EXTRACT structure (sections, patterns, fields)
  ↓
REPLACE content with research-backed design (from Steps 1-4)
  ↓
VERIFY against convention guide (Step 0a)
  ↓
WRITE premium workflow.yaml (structure preserved, content transformed)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Preserves BMAD structural conventions (from pathetic workflow)
- ✅ Replaces pathetic content with research-backed expertise (from conversion specs + Deep-Research)
- ✅ Ensures XML tag compliance (from workflow.xml reference)
- ✅ Follows variable patterns correctly (from convention guide)
- ✅ Results in premium workflow with proper structure (proven by optimize-performance)

---

### Step 1: Read Conversion Spec (IF EXISTS) OR Research Workflow Purpose

**Purpose:** Understand the original domain expertise and intent - either from conversion spec OR by researching the workflow's purpose.

---

#### Path A: Workflow HAS Conversion Spec Coverage

**Location:** `/docs/archive/gsap-excellence-build-sessions/conversion-specs/[AGENT]-WORKFLOW-CONVERSION-SPEC.md`

**Agent-to-Spec Mapping:**
- Director workflows → `DIRECTOR-WORKFLOW-CONVERSION-SPEC.md`
- Cinematographer workflows → `CINEMATOGRAPHER-WORKFLOW-CONVERSION-SPEC.md`
- Tech Director workflows → `TECH-DIRECTOR-WORKFLOW-CONVERSION-SPEC.md`
- VFX Artist workflows → `VFX-WORKFLOW-CONVERSION-SPEC.md`
- Editor workflows → `EDITOR-WORKFLOW-CONVERSION-SPEC.md`

**What to Extract:**
- Original workflow intent and goals
- Deep-Research sections referenced
- Frameworks and methodologies described
- Systematic protocols outlined
- Archon MCP priority sources

---

#### Path B: Workflow NOT in Conversion Spec (Build from Research)

**If workflow is not detailed in conversion spec**, build it purely from Deep-Research + Archon MCP:

**Step 1b-1: Research Workflow Purpose**

Use Archon MCP to research what this workflow should do:
```
rag_search_knowledge_base("[workflow-topic] GSAP patterns")
rag_search_knowledge_base("[workflow-topic] best practices")
rag_search_code_examples("[workflow-topic] GSAP")
```

**Step 1b-2: Examine Existing Workflow (if exists)**

Read current `workflow.yaml` and `instructions.md` to understand:
- Current description and intent
- Current inputs/outputs
- Current complexity level
- What's missing (research, depth, mandatory gates)

**Step 1b-3: Identify Relevant Deep-Research Sections**

Based on workflow topic, identify which Deep-Research sections apply:
- For timing/easing workflows → Sections 2.1, 2.2
- For ScrollTrigger workflows → Sections 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
- For animation creation → Sections 4.1-4.4
- For performance → Sections 5.1-5.6
- For accessibility → Sections 6.1-6.4
- For debugging → Sections 8.1-8.10

**Then proceed to Step 2 with your identified sections.**

**Example (optimize-performance):**
```markdown
From TECH-DIRECTOR-WORKFLOW-CONVERSION-SPEC.md:

**Optimization Protocol:**
<action>Reference ALL Performance Sections (5.1-5.6):
  - Section 5.1: GPU Rule → Are you animating transform/opacity only?
  - Section 5.2: Main Thread → Is animation taking <16ms per frame?
  - Section 5.3: Debugging Jank → Identify bottlenecks
  - Section 5.4: Memory Management → Check for leaks
  - Section 5.5: 60fps Optimization → Meet performance targets
  - Section 5.6: WebGL/Canvas → Consider alternative approaches?
</action>
```

### Step 2: Identify All Deep-Research Sections

**Purpose:** Create complete list of Deep-Research files needed for this workflow.

**Source:** Conversion spec lists all sections by number (e.g., "2.4, 5.1-5.6, 8.2")

**Deep-Research Base Path:**
`/docs/Deep-Research/GSAP-Animation-Mastery/`

**File Naming Pattern:**
`XX-YY-title.md` where:
- XX = section number (05, 18, 35, etc.)
- YY = sequential ID (21, 51, 82, etc.)
- title = kebab-case description

**Example Mapping (optimize-performance):**
```
Section 2.4 → 08-24-performance-patterns-and-optimization-techniques.md
Section 5.1 → 18-51-animate-efficient-properties-the-gpu-rule.md
Section 5.2 → 19-52-keep-the-main-thread-free-avoid-long-tasks.md
Section 5.3 → 20-53-debugging-jank.md
Section 5.4 → 21-54-memory-management-garbage-collection.md
Section 5.5 → 22-55-optimize-animations-for-60fps.md
Section 5.6 → 23-56-when-to-use-webglcanvas.md
Pitfall 8.2 → 35-pitfall-82-animating-the-wrong-properties-no-gpu-acceleration.md
```

**Verification:**
- Use `ls` to verify each file exists
- If file missing, search with `fd` or `rg` for title keywords
- Update mapping if file names changed

### Step 3: Read ALL Deep-Research Sections

**Purpose:** Extract actual expertise, frameworks, quotes, and examples from research.

**Critical Rule:** READ EVERY FILE IN FULL - no skimming, no assumptions.

**What to Extract from Each File:**

1. **Verbatim Quotes** (key insights, warnings, best practices)
   - Use italics with quotation marks: *"quote text here"*
   - Include source file in parentheses after quote

2. **Frameworks and Methodologies** (systematic approaches)
   - Step-by-step protocols
   - Decision trees
   - Checklists

3. **Code Examples** (before/after patterns)
   - Common mistakes
   - Correct implementations
   - Migration patterns

4. **Metrics and Thresholds** (specific numbers)
   - Performance budgets (e.g., 16ms frame budget)
   - Limits (e.g., <10 will-change layers)
   - Browser capabilities

**Example Extract (Section 5.1 - GPU Rule):**

**Quote:**
> *"Animating these means on each frame the browser recalculates the layout of possibly many elements -- very slow. AVOID animating these if at all possible."*
> (Source: 18-51-animate-efficient-properties-the-gpu-rule.md)

**Framework:**
- **GPU-accelerated properties:** transform (x, y, scale, rotate, skew), opacity, filters (with caution)
- **Expensive layout triggers:** top, left, right, bottom, width, height, margin, padding

**Threshold:**
> *"Typically under 10 layers is fine; dozens might be an issue on mobile."*
> (Source: 18-51-animate-efficient-properties-the-gpu-rule.md)

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (triggers layout):
gsap.to(element, { top: 100, left: 200 });

// AFTER (GPU-accelerated):
gsap.to(element, { y: 100, x: 200 });
```

### Step 4: Build Systematic Protocol with REAL Expertise

**Purpose:** Create instructions.md with research-backed protocols, not generic inference.

**Structure Requirements:**

1. **MANDATORY Research Gate** (blocking)
```xml
<research-gate enforcement="MANDATORY" blocking="true">
  <phase n="1" title="Deep-Research Section X.Y - [Title]" required="true">
    Read: {project-root}/docs/Deep-Research/GSAP-Animation-Mastery/XX-YY-title.md

    Extract and apply:
    - **[Framework Element]**: [Description]
      - *"[Verbatim quote from research]"*
    - **[Key Insight]**: [Specific guidance]
    - **[Code Pattern]**: [Before/after example]
  </phase>

  <checkpoint type="approval-gate" blocking="true">
    <action>Display research summary</action>
    <action>Show extracted insights</action>
    <ask>User must explicitly continue with "Continue [c]"</ask>
    <mandate>Agent cannot rationalize skipping - user input required</mandate>
  </checkpoint>
</research-gate>
```

2. **Systematic Protocol Steps** (numbered, sequential)
   - Each step references specific research
   - Include actual frameworks from Deep-Research
   - Use verbatim quotes for key insights
   - Provide before/after code examples

3. **Read Commands** (point to actual Deep-Research files)
```xml
Read: {project-root}/docs/Deep-Research/GSAP-Animation-Mastery/XX-YY-title.md
```

4. **Research Citations** (throughout protocol)
   - Quote important insights verbatim
   - Reference source file in parentheses
   - Build on research frameworks, don't infer

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ "Section X.Y recommends..." (without quote)
- ❌ "Best practices suggest..." (without research citation)
- ❌ Generic advice that could apply to any library
- ❌ Inferring what research "should say"

### Step 5: Create All 4 Workflow Files

## Agent Audit Checklist

This checklist applies to EACH agent. Perform AFTER rebuilding all workflows owned by that agent.

### Agent Overview

- **Agent Name:** gsap-[role]
- **Agent File:** `/bmad/gsap-excellence/agents/gsap-[role].md`
- **Owned Workflows:** (list all workflows this agent runs)
- **Audit Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Audited By:** [Name]

### Step 1: Read Agent Config

- [ ] **Read COMPLETE agent config file**
- [ ] **Extract agent persona** (role, identity, communication style, principles)
- [ ] **Extract agent knowledge references** (sidecar files, Deep-Research sections)
- [ ] **Extract agent capabilities** (what this agent can/cannot do)
- [ ] **Extract agent workflows** (menu items with workflow paths)

### Step 2: Analyze Agent Persona

- [ ] **Is persona clearly defined?**
  - Role description clear and specific?
  - Identity/character established?
  - Communication style defined?
- [ ] **Is persona lightweight?**
  - Persona is role + character (not detailed protocols)?
  - Detailed "how-to" guidance in workflows (not agent)?
  - Agent provides context, workflows provide execution?
- [ ] **Does persona match BMAD best practice?**
  - BMM example: Agents are personas, workflows are detailed
  - BMB example: Heavy workflows, light agents
  - This agent follows same pattern?

### Step 3: Audit Knowledge References

For EACH knowledge reference in agent config:

- [ ] **Does reference still exist?** (file path valid?)
- [ ] **Does reference align with workflow research?**
  - If agent references Section X, do workflows use Section X?
  - If agent references sidecar file, do workflows point to Deep-Research instead?
- [ ] **Is reference used correctly?**
  - Agent loads at startup (context setting)?
  - Workflow reads during execution (systematic application)?

### Step 4: Check Agent-Workflow Alignment

For EACH workflow owned by this agent:

- [ ] **Workflow name:** [workflow-name]
- [ ] **Agent persona supports this workflow?**
  - Agent role matches workflow goals?
  - No contradictions between agent identity and workflow purpose?
- [ ] **Agent knowledge aligns with workflow research?**
  - Agent references same Deep-Research sections?
  - Agent sidecar knowledge summarizes what workflow applies?
- [ ] **Division of labor clear?**
  - Agent: Provides context, role, character
  - Workflow: Provides systematic protocol, detailed steps, research gates

### Step 5: Identify Conflicts and Contradictions

Document ANY of the following:

- [ ] **Persona Conflicts**
  - Agent persona contradicts workflow instructions
  - Example: Agent says "move fast" but workflow requires deep research
  - Fix: Align agent persona with workflow rigor

- [ ] **Knowledge Conflicts**
  - Agent references different Deep-Research sections than workflow
  - Agent sidecar file contradicts workflow research
  - Fix: Update agent knowledge references to match workflow

- [ ] **Capability Conflicts**
  - Agent claims capability workflow doesn't deliver
  - Workflow requires capability agent doesn't have
  - Fix: Align agent capabilities description with workflow deliverables

- [ ] **Heavy Agent, Light Workflow** (WRONG)
  - Agent has detailed protocols and step-by-step guidance
  - Workflow has minimal instructions
  - Fix: Move detailed guidance from agent to workflow

### Step 6: Propose Alignment Fixes

For EACH conflict identified:

- [ ] **Conflict:** [Description]
- [ ] **Impact:** [How this affects workflow execution]
- [ ] **Proposed Fix:** [Specific changes to agent config or workflow]
- [ ] **Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]

### Step 7: Implement Alignment Fixes

For EACH proposed fix:

- [ ] **Apply fix to agent config** (if agent needs updating)
- [ ] **Apply fix to workflow** (if workflow needs updating)
- [ ] **Test agent-workflow integration** (run workflow with updated agent)
- [ ] **Verify no new conflicts introduced**
- [ ] **Document changes** (what was changed and why)

### Step 8: Agent Audit Completion

- [ ] **All owned workflows audited**
- [ ] **All conflicts identified and documented**
- [ ] **All alignment fixes implemented**
- [ ] **Agent config follows BMAD best practice** (lightweight, persona-focused)
- [ ] **All workflows follow BMAD best practice** (heavyweight, protocol-detailed)
- [ ] **Update progress tracker** (agent audit complete)

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk #1: Batch Creation Temptation

**Risk:** Attempting to rebuild multiple workflows simultaneously to "save time."

**Impact:** Returns to the same pattern that created 17 pathetic workflows.

**Probability:** HIGH (efficiency bias)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **ONE AT A TIME RULE** - Hardcoded in this plan, non-negotiable
2. **Completion Gate** - Mark workflow 100% complete before starting next
3. **Research Enforcement Test** - MUST pass before moving on
4. **Time Boxing** - Schedule 1-2 hours per workflow (prevents rushing)
5. **Progress Tracking** - Visual progress bar reinforces sequential completion

**Warning Signs:**
- Thinking "I could do 3 workflows today if I..."
- Copying template patterns without reading conversion spec
- Skipping Deep-Research file reads
- Inferring what research "should say"

**If Warning Signs Detected:**
- HALT immediately
- Re-read this Risk Mitigation section
- Verify current workflow is 100% complete (checklist)
- Get Cameron's approval before proceeding

### Risk #2: Research Enforcement Bypass

**Risk:** Building workflows with research gates that can be skipped or rationalized away.

**Impact:** Workflows look premium but research isn't actually enforced - defeats entire purpose.

**Probability:** MEDIUM (AI rationalization tendency)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Research Enforcement Test** - MANDATORY in every checklist.md
2. **Test Before Moving On** - Execute workflow and attempt to skip gate
3. **Blocking Attribute Required** - `blocking="true"` on all approval-gates
4. **User Input Required** - "Continue [c]" must be explicit
5. **Spot Check Audits** - Cameron tests random workflows periodically

**Warning Signs:**
- Research gate missing `blocking="true"`
- No `<checkpoint type="approval-gate">` tags
- Agent can proceed without user input
- Research feels "optional" when testing

**If Warning Signs Detected:**
- HALT workflow deployment
- Fix research enforcement immediately
- Re-test until gate is truly blocking
- Document fix in this plan

### Risk #3: Hallucinated Research Content

**Risk:** Writing plausible-sounding expertise without actually reading Deep-Research files.

**Impact:** Workflows look research-backed but contain generic/inferred content.

**Probability:** MEDIUM (AI inference tendency)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Verbatim Quote Requirement** - 10+ quotes per instructions.md
2. **Source Citation Audit** - Every quote has (Source: filename.md)
3. **Spot Check Verification** - Cameron verifies 5 random quotes per workflow
4. **Read Command Audit** - All Read commands point to actual Deep-Research files
5. **No Inference Rule** - Never write "Section X says..." without quote

**Warning Signs:**
- Quotes without source citations
- Generic advice that could apply to any library
- No before/after code examples
- Frameworks described but not quoted

**If Warning Signs Detected:**
- HALT content generation
- Read ACTUAL Deep-Research file
- Extract VERBATIM quote
- Replace inferred content with real research
- Add source citation

### Risk #4: File Path Errors

**Risk:** Workflows pointing to wrong files (agent sidecars instead of Deep-Research).

**Impact:** Workflows load meta-files instead of actual expertise.

**Probability:** LOW (already caught and fixed)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **File Path Verification** - `ls` every Read command path
2. **Deep-Research Base Check** - All paths start with `/docs/Deep-Research/GSAP-Animation-Mastery/`
3. **No Sidecar References** - Never point to `gsap-[role]/research-knowledge.md`
4. **Automated Check** - grep for `gsap-[role]/` in instructions.md (should be 0 results)

**Warning Signs:**
- Read commands with `gsap-cinematographer/` or similar
- File paths that don't start with `/docs/Deep-Research/`
- Files that don't exist when ls checked

**If Warning Signs Detected:**
- Fix file paths immediately
- Verify files exist with ls
- Update workflow.yaml deep_research_base
- Re-test workflow execution

### Risk #5: Token-Saving Rationalization (CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERN)

**Risk:** AI simplifies/abbreviates work to "save tokens" instead of doing complete, thorough work.

**Impact:** INCOMPLETE workflows that look done but lack depth, verbatim quotes, or complete protocols. This defeats the ENTIRE purpose of the rebuild.

**Probability:** HIGH (AI natural tendency to conserve resources)

**THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS RISK - It produces workflows that LOOK premium but are actually still pathetic.**

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. **CAMERON'S DIRECTIVE (OVERRIDES EVERYTHING):**
   ```
   "DO NOT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT TOKEN CONSTRAINTS.
   Do the FULL job. If you run out of tokens, I'll figure it out."
   ```

2. **Token Management is Cameron's Job, NOT Yours:**
   - Your ONLY job: Complete, thorough, premium work
   - Cameron handles: Token limits, session continuation, context management
   - If you hit the hard limit: That's Cameron's problem, not yours

3. **NEVER Do These Things:**
   - ❌ Simplify instructions.md to "save space"
   - ❌ Skip Deep-Research files to "conserve context"
   - ❌ Reduce verbatim quotes because "already at 150k tokens"
   - ❌ Batch checklist items to "be more efficient"
   - ❌ Abbreviate protocols because "it's getting long"
   - ❌ Use Read offset/limit to "reduce token usage"
   - ❌ Think "I should keep this short"

4. **ONLY Do These Things:**
   - ✅ Read COMPLETE files (entire Deep-Research sections)
   - ✅ Extract ALL relevant verbatim quotes (10-30+, not 2-3)
   - ✅ Build COMPLETE protocols (1,000-1,700+ lines)
   - ✅ Include ALL code examples from research
   - ✅ Create COMPREHENSIVE validation checklists
   - ✅ Do the FULL job, period

5. **Quality Comes First:**
   - Better to hit token limit with complete work than stay under with incomplete work
   - Cameron would rather continue a session than get abbreviated results
   - Premium workflows are 2,000-3,000+ lines - that takes tokens, and that's OK

**Warning Signs (YOU'RE ABOUT TO FUCK UP):**
- Thinking: "This is getting long, I should shorten it"
- Thinking: "I'm at 100k tokens, better wrap up"
- Thinking: "Maybe I'll summarize instead of quoting verbatim"
- Thinking: "I'll just reference the research instead of reading it"
- Thinking: "The checklist is detailed enough, no need to add more"
- Feeling pressure to "be efficient" with tokens

**If You Catch Yourself Doing This:**
- STOP immediately
- Re-read Cameron's directive at the top of this document
- Remember: Token management is Cameron's job
- Continue with COMPLETE, THOROUGH work
- Trust that Cameron will handle continuation if needed

**The ONLY Acceptable Reasons to Stop:**
1. Anthropic hard token limit blocks you (can't proceed)
2. Cameron explicitly tells you to stop

**Cameron's Philosophy:**
"The only one who should ever be worrying about tokens is me. Your job is quality, not efficiency. Do the full job. I'll figure out the tokens."

### Risk #6: Agent-Workflow Misalignment

**Risk:** Agent config contradicts workflow instructions, causing confusion during execution.

**Impact:** Workflows don't execute as intended, user confusion, quality degradation.

**Probability:** MEDIUM (agent configs haven't been audited yet)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Agent Audit Phase** - Mandatory after workflows rebuilt
2. **Conflict Documentation** - Log all contradictions found
3. **Alignment Fixes** - Update agent or workflow to resolve
4. **Heavy Workflow, Light Agent** - Follow BMAD best practice
5. **Integration Testing** - Run workflow with agent, verify behavior

**Warning Signs:**
- Agent persona says "fast" but workflow requires deep research
- Agent references different Deep-Research sections than workflow
- Agent has detailed protocols that conflict with workflow

**If Warning Signs Detected:**
- Document conflict in agent audit checklist
- Propose alignment fix
- Get Cameron's approval
- Implement fix
- Re-test integration

### Appendix C: File Path Patterns

**Correct Pattern (Deep-Research):**
```xml
Read: {project-root}/docs/Deep-Research/GSAP-Animation-Mastery/XX-YY-title.md
```

**WRONG Pattern (Agent Sidecar - NEVER USE):**
```xml
Read: {project-root}/bmad/gsap-excellence/agents/gsap-cinematographer/research-knowledge.md
```

**Why Agent Sidecars Are Wrong:**
- They are META-FILES that summarize research
- They don't contain the actual detailed expertise
- They're for agent context-loading at startup, NOT workflow execution
- Reading them is like reading a book's table of contents instead of chapters

**Agent Sidecar File Locations (For Reference Only):**
- `/bmad/gsap-excellence/agents/gsap-cinematographer/research-knowledge.md`
- `/bmad/gsap-excellence/agents/gsap-cinematographer/pitfalls-knowledge.md`
- `/bmad/gsap-excellence/agents/gsap-cinematographer/knowledge-integration.md`
- (Similar structure for other agents)

**When to Reference Sidecars:**
- ONLY in agent config files (for startup context loading)
- NEVER in workflow instructions

### Appendix D: MCP Server Usage Guidelines

#### Archon MCP (GSAP Knowledge Base)

**Total Sources:** 89

2. `rag_search_knowledge_base(query, source_id, return_mode="pages")` - Semantic search
3. `rag_search_code_examples(query, source_id)` - Find code snippets
4. `rag_list_pages_for_source(source_id, section)` - Browse structure
5. `rag_read_full_page(page_id)` - Get complete page content

**Priority Sources (from optimize-performance):**
- `b9f6b322298feb21` - gsap.com official docs
- `6a6860cfc96e173b` - ScrollTrigger performance guide
- `1e5cc3bd5125be3c` - Codrops GSAP tutorials

**Search Best Practices:**

**When to Use:**
- Pattern discovery (creative-ideation workflow)
- Best practice verification (all workflows)
- Code example searches (implement-from-pattern)
- Latest GSAP updates (validate-modern)
