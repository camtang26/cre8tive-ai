code_example: |
  import { gsap } from 'gsap';

  // Staggered grid reveal with premium timing
  const gridItems = document.querySelectorAll('[data-grid-item]');

  gsap.from(gridItems, {
    opacity: 0,
    scale: 0.8,
    y: 30,
    duration: 0.6,
    ease: "back.out(1.2)", // Bouncy premium easing
    stagger: {
      amount: 0.8, // Total stagger duration
      from: "start", // Options: "start", "center", "edges", "random", "end"
      grid: "auto", // Auto-detect grid dimensions
      ease: "power2.inOut" // Easing for stagger distribution
    },
    // Optional: delay start
    delay: 0.2
  });

usage_notes: |
  HTML Structure:
  <div class="grid">
    <div data-grid-item>Item 1</div>
    <div data-grid-item>Item 2</div>
    <div data-grid-item>Item 3</div>
    ...
  </div>

  Works with any grid layout (CSS Grid, Flexbox, etc.)
  Automatically detects grid dimensions with grid: "auto"

variations:
  from_center: "Change from: 'start' to from: 'center'"
  from_edges: "Change from: 'start' to from: 'edges'"
  random_order: "Change from: 'start' to from: 'random'"
  wave_effect: "Use stagger: { each: 0.1, from: 'start' } for wave"
  manual_grid: "Specify grid: [columns, rows] like grid: [3, 4]"

advanced_stagger: |
  // Advanced stagger with custom function
  stagger: {
    each: 0.1,
    from: "center",
    grid: "auto",
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    // Custom stagger function based on position
    amount: (index, target, list) => {
      // Stagger based on distance from center
      return index * 0.05;
    }
  }

performance_tips:
  - Use transform and opacity only
  - Set will-change: transform, opacity during animation
  - Limit to 20-30 items for best performance
  - Use once: true if animation only plays once
  - Consider virtualization for large grids (100+ items)

accessibility:
  reduced_motion: "Show all items immediately without stagger"
  implementation: |
    if (window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches) {
      gsap.set(gridItems, { opacity: 1, scale: 1, y: 0 });
      return;
    }
