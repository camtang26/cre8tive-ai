‚ùå **Hit or miss** - Generative art is subjective, may not resonate
‚ùå **Requires iteration** - Need to experiment to find right aesthetic
‚ùå **2D limitation** - No depth like 3D solutions
‚ùå **Math knowledge** - Some algorithms require understanding of noise, vectors, etc.

#### Fit for Cre8tive AI Briefing Engine

**Alignment Score: 6.5/10** - Moderate fit, depends on creative direction

**Why it works:**

- **Framer Motion synergy** - Perfect integration with existing stack
- **Organic evolution** - Visualizes "brief evolving into storyboard"
- **Unique on every visit** - Memorable, dynamic
- **Artistic positioning** - Aligns with "creative" in brand name

**Why it might not fit:**
- Less "AI/tech" feel than 3D or shaders
- More abstract, less literal visualization
- May not communicate "cutting-edge technology" as strongly
- Artistic interpretation subjective

**Potential implementations:**
1. **Flow Field Particles** - Particles following curved paths, forming/dissolving
2. **Noise-Based Terrain** - Undulating organic shapes, gradient colors
3. **Autonomous Agents** - Flocking behavior creating emergent patterns

5. **Brush Strokes** - Algorithmic painting effect (brief ‚Üí storyboard as art)

**Recommended variation:**
**Flow field with gradient particles** (indigo‚Üícyan‚Üífuchsia) creating organic, flowing patterns. Particles follow invisible vector field, creating sense of directed creativity and flow.

**Best use case:**
When brand wants to emphasize **creativity and artistic sophistication** over pure technology. Works well if "AI as creative tool" is the narrative.
