## Architecture References

**Foundation Context:** This story establishes the animation framework for the entire Briefing Engine page.

**Library Decision Tree:** `docs/architecture/animation-patterns.md` (lines 1-60)

**Why This Stack?**
- **GSAP + ScrollTrigger:** Scroll-driven timelines, parallax effects, scrub animations
  - Use for: Gallery reveals, process flow timelines, transformation sequences
  - Pattern: `gsap.context()` with cleanup (prevents memory leaks)

- **Lenis:** Momentum-based smooth scrolling
  - Use for: Page-level smooth scroll with GSAP integration
  - Pattern: `<ReactLenis>` wrapper (declarative) or imperative instance

- **Framer Motion:** UI micro-interactions (hover, tap, drag)
  - Use for: Button hovers, card lifts, modal animations
  - Pattern: `whileHover`, `whileTap` declarative animations

**Key Integration Pattern:** Lenis + GSAP Sync
```typescript
// Reference: animation-patterns.md lines 338-361
const lenis = useLenis(({ scroll }) => {
  ScrollTrigger.update()  // Sync ScrollTrigger with Lenis scroll
})
```

**React Cleanup Pattern:** All GSAP animations MUST use cleanup
```typescript
// Reference: animation-patterns.md lines 98-146
useEffect(() => {
  const ctx = gsap.context(() => {
    // GSAP animations
  }, containerRef)

  return () => ctx.revert()  // CRITICAL: Prevents memory leaks
}, [])
```

**Related Documentation:**
- `docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md` Section 6: Animation Stack
- `docs/architecture/animation-patterns.md` Complete patterns guide
- `src/hooks/useScrollTriggerAnimation.ts` Generic GSAP hook

**Bundle Impact:**
- GSAP Core: ~48kb
- ScrollTrigger: ~18kb
- Lenis: ~7kb
- **Total:** ~73kb (within acceptable range for flagship product page)

---

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: Existing Framer Motion animations still function (home page, studios page hover states)
- **IV2**: React Router navigation not broken by Lenis wrapper (test route changes)
- **IV3**: Build time not significantly increased (< 10% slower acceptable)

---

## Tasks

- [x] Install GSAP core library and React integration (`npm install gsap @gsap/react`)
- [x] Install Lenis smooth scroll library (`npm install lenis`)
- [x] Create test component to verify ScrollTrigger registration works
- [x] Create Lenis wrapper component and test on sample page
- [x] Run production build and verify no TypeScript/bundling errors
- [x] Verify bundle size increase is within acceptable range (~73kb total)
- [x] Update ARCHITECTURE.md with GSAP + Lenis in animation stack section
- [x] Test Integration Verification IV1 (Framer Motion still works)
- [x] Test Integration Verification IV2 (React Router navigation works)
- [x] Test Integration Verification IV3 (Build time not significantly increased)

## Technical Notes

**Animation Stack:**
- **GSAP Core:** ~48kb (core animation engine)
- **ScrollTrigger:** ~18kb (scroll-driven animations)
- **Lenis:** ~7kb (smooth scroll with momentum)
- **Total Impact:** ~73kb (acceptable for flagship product page)

**Installation Commands:**
```bash
npm install gsap @gsap/react
npm install lenis
```

**GSAP Registration Pattern:**
```tsx
import { useGSAP } from '@gsap/react';
import gsap from 'gsap';
import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger';

gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);
```

**Lenis Wrapper Pattern:**
```tsx
import { ReactLenis } from 'lenis/react';

export function BriefingEngine() {
  return (
    <ReactLenis root options={{ lerp: 0.1, duration: 1.5, smoothTouch: true }}>
      {/* Page content */}
    </ReactLenis>
  );
}
```

**Why Lenis (not @studio-freight/react-lenis):**
- Upgraded package (maintained)
- Better React 18 compatibility
- Smaller bundle size
- Smoother touch behavior on mobile
