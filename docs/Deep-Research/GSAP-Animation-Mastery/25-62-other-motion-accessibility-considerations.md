### 6.2 Other Motion Accessibility Considerations

Beyond `prefers-reduced-motion`, think of: - **Flashing content:** WCAG 2.3.1 says no content should flash more than 3 times per second (especially high intensity red flashes) as it can trigger seizures. Ensure animations do not have rapid blinking. For example, avoid quickly strobing an element's visibility. If you need a flicker effect, keep it slow or subtle, or provide warning. - **Focus management:** If your animation involves moving or opening new content (like a modal Flip in, or new section appears), consider keyboard focus: - If a modal opens via Flip, you should typically move focus to the modal (e.g., the close button) so screen reader and keyboard users are inside it. When closing, return focus to the trigger that opened it. - GSAP doesn't handle focus by itself, but your surrounding code should. For instance:

```
myButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  openModalAnimation.play();
  document.getElementById('closeBtn').focus();
});
closeBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  closeModalAnimation.play().then(() => myButton.focus());
});
```

\- Ensure that while something like a modal is open, if other content is behind it, it's not focusable (add `aria-hidden="true"` to background perhaps). Otherwise, a user tabbing might end up behind the overlay which is confusing. - **Screen reader visibility vs visual**: If you do fancy text splits (SplitText) or hide stuff, ensure screen reader can still read content logically: - SplitText by default keeps a copy of the text content in an `aria-label` on the container, I believe, or marks the pieces as presentational. Verify this. If not, you may need to provide an alternative (like setting `aria-hidden="true"` on the split pieces and an `aria-label` on container). - If you animate an element off-screen or opacity 0, but it's still in DOM, a screen reader will still encounter it. If it's meant to be hidden, add `aria-hidden="true"` while invisible. - Conversely, if content appears that wasn't there, ensure it gets added to accessibility tree (e.g., don't forget to remove `aria-hidden` when you reveal something intended to be read). - **Pause/stop mechanism for long animations:** WCAG 2.2.2 requires that for any animation that lasts more than 5 seconds (and is not user-controlled or essential), the user should have a way to pause or stop it. For example: - If you have a looping background animation, consider adding a "Pause Animations" button or respecting reduced-motion to essentially pause it. - GSAP can globally pause with `gsap.globalTimeline.pause()` if you needed a brute force pause (though it might pause some essential ones, so better to target the decorative ones). - Alternatively, design your animations to either stop after a few loops or only run on interaction. - **Content accessibility during animations:** While something is animating, ensure it's not preventing usage: - If a user needs to click a button but you have a long animation going that covers it or distracts, consider shortening it or making it interruptible. - If using ScrollTrigger pinning, ensure pinning doesn't trap keyboard focus (like if focus moves into pinned content and user tries to scroll via keyboard, should still work). - **Testing with assistive tech:** Use a screen reader and navigate your page. The presence of animations should not confuse the reading order: - E.g., if you animate in sections one after another, the DOM order ideally should match visual order, so screen reader reads in logical order anyway (which is a general dev principle). - Ensure important announcements can be conveyed. For instance, if an error message slides in, a screen reader should be notified (set `role="alert"` on it or focus it). - Use `prefers-reduced-motion` as a proxy for those who might also not want distracted by motion for cognitive reasons too.
