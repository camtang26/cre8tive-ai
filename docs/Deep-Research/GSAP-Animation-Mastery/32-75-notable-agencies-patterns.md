### 7.5 Notable Agencies & Patterns

Some agencies are known for certain animation styles: - **Active Theory**: Known for WebGL + GSAP. They often have immersive experiences (e.g., "Pottermore" or Google experiments). Pattern: heavy use of GSAP for camera moves and syncing DOM/UI with WebGL scenes. They push boundaries with 3D, but GSAP is often behind the timeline of events. - **Resn** (New Zealand): Often quirky interactive pieces. They might use a lot of unique easings and playful SVG animations. Pattern: creative use of custom eases and staggers to create surprising motions (like bouncing letters or liquid effects). Possibly use custom plugins (like CustomWiggle or CustomBounce) -- GSAP has those (CustomWiggle plugin to create wiggly ease). - **ToyFight** (UK): The one that did "Building GSAP, ASAP" for GreenSock's brand[\[40\]](https://www.awwwards.com/building-gsap-asap.html#:~:text=It%20goes%20without%20saying%2C%20but,where%20we%20could%20take%20it)[\[41\]](https://www.awwwards.com/building-gsap-asap.html#:~:text=We%20were%20asked%20to%20conceive,to%20tool%20for%20animation). They integrated GSAP deep in Webflow site, showing that mixing GSAP with content management is feasible. Pattern: they used Eleventy and vanilla JS for transparency, as mentioned[\[42\]](https://www.awwwards.com/building-gsap-asap.html#:~:text=gsap,platform%20work)[\[43\]](https://www.awwwards.com/building-gsap-asap.html#:~:text=For%20the%20dynamic%20aspects%20of,and%20enthusiasts%20to%20explore%20the). Their work likely emphasizes precise, minimalistic animations aligning with design (given it's GSAP's own site). - **Dutch agencies (e.g., MediaMonks, Build in Amsterdam)**: They often do slick product showcase animations: subtle parallax, smooth carousels, etc. Often they combine GSAP with three.js (for 3D models of products). Pattern: combining 3D model animations (which can be tweened via GSAP) with ScrollTrigger for reveal sequences.

**Trends (2023-2025):** - Use of **Scroll-driven animations** has only increased -- thanks to ScrollTrigger making it easier. Many sites with high engagement use scroll narratives. - **SVG and Canvas micro-animations**: like animated logos, cursor effects (e.g., a custom cursor trail that is done via GSAP quickSetter to smoothly interpolate cursor movement). - **MatchMedia usage**: because of the multitude of device sizes, best sites tailor animations per breakpoint. E.g., heavy desktop animations toned down on mobile. We see more of that explicit handling (like "on mobile, simpler transitions"). - **License change**: GSAP's free plugins means even more widespread adoption in award sites (previously some might avoid ScrollTrigger due to license, now no barrier). That suggests new sites might incorporate Flip and ScrollSmoother more, since 2024 onwards it's free.

In essence, analyzing these cases and studios, we identify a common thread: **systematic use of GSAP's tools (timeline, scroll, plugins) combined with creative storytelling**. The technology allows these agencies to focus on creativity.

**AI should learn**: Approach each animation challenge by thinking "How would Active Theory or Locomotive do this?" -- likely modular timelines, scroll linking, heavy optimization, and always thinking of the user's perspective (control, pacing).

By following the patterns from these case studies (scroll-based control for narrative, breaking complex animations into segments, optimizing loading of heavy assets, and leveraging GSAP plugins to simplify tough tasks), AI can produce solutions on par with those leading studios.
