### 6.4 Educate Users and Offer Control

For very animation-heavy experiences (like artistic sites), consider informing the user or giving control: - Some award sites have a toggle "Enable Effects" or "Turn off animations" in a menu. This is above and beyond the OS-level setting (which not all users know about). Providing an in-site toggle empowers users. Implementing it might involve toggling a class that your GSAP code checks to skip animations, or dynamically adjusting timeline.timeScale. - At minimum, ensure your documentation or help section mentions that the site has animations and how to disable if needed (either via browser setting or an available toggle). - If any animation could be potentially disorienting (like a VR or AR experience in web), provide a warning or introductory prompt. - For users with cognitive disabilities, too much motion can be distracting even if not physically sickening. Consider the content: does the animation help understanding or might it confuse? If the latter, consider simplifying or giving an option to turn it off. E.g., an autoplay carousel of text might be hard for some to read -- better to let them control it.

**In summary:** Accessibility is not at odds with fancy animations -- you just need to build flexibly: - **Responsive to user settings**: This is straightforward with matchMedia and conditional tweens[\[23\]](https://gsap.com/resources/a11y/#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20some,for%20people%20with%20motion%20sensitivities)[\[24\]](https://gsap.com/resources/a11y/#:~:text=We%20can%20listen%20to%20this,matchMedia). - **Ensuring usability**: sometimes just adding `outline` on focus, or pausing an animation on hover if it might interfere (like stop auto-scroll when user hovers content to interact). - **Following guidelines**: WCAG's relevant parts (2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide; 2.3.1 Three Flashes; 2.3.3 Animation from interactions -- which basically says if motion animation is triggered by a user action, there should be a way to disable it unless essential). For 2.3.3 (AAA level): An example is: if a link has a hover animation that moves it, provide a setting to disable that movement, because some users might find it problematic when trying to click. That's an extreme case, but something to be aware of.

**Sources (Part 6):** W3C's specs on `prefers-reduced-motion` and numerous blog posts emphasize toggling or removing animations[\[23\]](https://gsap.com/resources/a11y/#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20some,for%20people%20with%20motion%20sensitivities)[\[24\]](https://gsap.com/resources/a11y/#:~:text=We%20can%20listen%20to%20this,matchMedia). Smashing Magazine and others have articles on "accessible animation" stressing exactly the steps we've described (use user preference, avoid big motions, etc.). The GSAP docs specifically illustrate using `matchMedia` for reduced motion, as we referenced[\[23\]](https://gsap.com/resources/a11y/#:~:text=Did%20you%20know%20that%20some,for%20people%20with%20motion%20sensitivities)[\[24\]](https://gsap.com/resources/a11y/#:~:text=We%20can%20listen%20to%20this,matchMedia). Our advice also aligns with official APG (ARIA practices) about focus management on modals, etc. By implementing these, AI ensures animations are a progressive enhancement, not a hindrance, for all users.
