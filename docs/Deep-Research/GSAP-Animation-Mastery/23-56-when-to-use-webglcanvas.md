### 5.6 When to Use WebGL/Canvas

For truly heavy visual effects (thousands of objects, complex shaders), consider moving to WebGL (Three.js) or Canvas for that portion: - Example: A starfield with 5000 stars moving -- doing that in DOM is not feasible at 60fps. Instead draw on canvas, and use GSAP to animate properties of the starfield (like overall rotation or camera position) rather than each star as a DOM. - Another example: Animating a video or huge background with shaders -- use WebGL and maybe GSAP just to tween parameters (like tweening uniform values in a shader). - GSAP works nicely with these -- e.g., tween Three.js `mesh.rotation` or a pixi.js sprite's alpha, etc. - But for typical UI (tens or even a few hundred elements), DOM + GSAP is fine with proper techniques.

**Conclusion:** Performance is an ongoing consideration. The best practice is to **build with performance in mind from the start (using transforms, etc.)**, then test and refine. By following the guidelines above, you significantly reduce the likelihood of janky animations. A smoothly animated interface feels more high-end and allows the creative work to shine without technical distractions. Users may not consciously applaud smoothness, but they will subconsciously feel the quality. And on the flip side, even the coolest animation concept will flop if it's choppy.

**Sources (Part 5):** GSAP forum advice stresses content of animations as the common bottleneck[\[25\]](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/23062-questions-about-performance-best-practices/#:~:text=People%20always%20ask%20about%20how,optimizing%20it). The MDN docs on `will-change` warn of misuse[\[21\]](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/18097-performance-and-visual-optimizations/#:~:text=,provide%20a%20significant%20performance%20boost). Real project postmortems often show optimizing animations by reducing simultaneous animations or switching to canvas for particle effects. The policies of using transform over layout properties are well-established best practices[\[19\]](https://gsap.com/community/forums/topic/23062-questions-about-performance-best-practices/#:~:text=Performance%20problems%20are%20almost%20always,much%20faster%20than%20animating%20left%2Ftop), as is avoiding heavy onUpdate logic. By adhering to these, AI can match the performance discipline of expert developers.
