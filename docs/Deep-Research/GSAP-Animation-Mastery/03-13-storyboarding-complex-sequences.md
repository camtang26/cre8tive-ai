### 1.3 Storyboarding Complex Sequences

For "museum-grade" animations, a single effect often spans an entire page or section, involving many elements over time. Planning these requires storyboarding and timeline thinking: - **Define Sections or Scenes:** Break the page into logical sections if applicable (hero, about section, gallery, etc.). Consider how the user navigates through them (scroll or click) and how animations transition between sections. Each section might be a scene with its own mini-timeline. - **Use Temporal Landmarks:** Identify start, middle, and end points of the overall sequence. Example: *Start:* page load -- initial state; *Middle:* user scrolls and triggers mid-animation; *End:* animation completes or loops. By pinning down these landmarks, you can ensure the animation has a clear beginning and resolution. - **Timeline Sketch:** Draw a rough timeline (on paper or mentally) marking when each element starts and ends its motion. This is like a musical score for motion. For instance, mark at 0s: background fade in; 0.5s: heading enters; 1s: heading exits while image zooms, etc. This exercise reveals overlaps and dependencies (e.g., image shouldn't zoom until heading is gone). - **Parallel vs Sequential:** Decide which motions happen in parallel and which in sequence. World-class animations often layer motions (parallel) for richness, but maintain clarity by sequencing major changes. *Example:* While a section background color changes (a slow parallel fade), a series of content cards might animate one after another (sequentially). The combined effect is a dynamic but coherent flow. **AI models should avoid** triggering everything at once with equal timing -- that often feels chaotic. Use GSAP timelines to carefully overlap or sequence tweens as needed (e.g., use timeline positions or staggers to offset). - **Ease and Intensity Planning:** Mark where to use different easing for effect. Perhaps the intro is gentle (easeOut), the mid-section is bouncy and playful, the ending snappy (easeIn). Considering easing early helps set the emotional tone. (We'll dive deeper into eases in Part 2.)

**Storyboarding Example:** Imagine a "museum-grade" homepage where on scroll, content animates: Section 1 pins and shows title text, then morphs into Section 2 with a gallery. A storyboard might note: "Section 1: large title appears with a Flip animation, subtext fades. After 3s or on scroll 25%, camera icon floats in (ease bounce). Section 2: when entering, pin background, gallery images stagger-fade in. As user scrolls further, images scale up one by one. On leaving section, all images fade out." -- This narrative guides the GSAP ScrollTrigger and timeline setup.

By adopting these planning techniques, AI models can **mimic the creative foresight of human animators**. The output stops being a raw sequence of code and becomes an intentional, art-directed animation. Remember, an expert developer spends significant time *planning and visualizing* -- not just coding. Before moving on, mentally rehearse the entire animation as if you've already coded it; this mental model will inform every line of GSAP code to come.
