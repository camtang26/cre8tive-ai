### 7.3 Apple's AirPods Pro site (not specifically cited above but a known example)

*(We include this as a known case even without direct document citation, as it's famous.)*\
**Background:** Apple product pages (like AirPods Pro) often feature animations as you scroll: e.g., the AirPods rotate in 3D, parts explode out to show internals, text highlights features in sync.

**Techniques used:** - They use videos or image sequences with ScrollTrigger to scrub through (for smooth 3D rotation, they might use a pre-rendered video or a sprite sheet of images, then scrub the current time or frame). - Pinning is heavily used: each segment of the story pins the visuals while text scrolls or changes. - For example, "Noise Cancellation" section pins an AirPod image, and as you scroll, waves representing noise diminish (animated via GSAP or canvas) and eventually the text "Noise Cancelled" appears -- all while the image stays fixed. - Apple likely uses a combination of CSS (for some basic transitions) and GSAP for orchestrating the complex stuff.

**Key Takeaways:** - **Image sequence scrubbing**: If you have high fidelity 3D but can't do real-time, use a sequence of images (canvas draw or swapping img src) and scrub through them with GSAP (there's an official GSAP example doing this). This yields a super smooth pseudo-3D animation under scroll control. - **Layered pinning**: Apple might pin an element, then animate children within it via timeline. They also use `position: sticky` in CSS sometimes -- but GSAP's pin is more flexible when combined with timeline control (and works cross-browser better). - **Performance**: Apple ensures it works on mobile by often swapping to static images or simpler illustrations on smaller screens (i.e., not all fancy effects appear on older devices). - **Narrative**: Each scroll length is tuned so the user has time to read the text while the visuals play out. This is a storytelling rhythm -- not too short (user misses it), not too long (user gets bored).

Apple's approach often becomes a template for others, and GSAP/ScrollTrigger is fully capable of replicating it. Many web agencies create similar sections (some directly cite using GSAP for Apple-like animations).
