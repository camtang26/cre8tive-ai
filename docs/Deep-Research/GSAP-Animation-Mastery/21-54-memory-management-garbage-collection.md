### 5.4 Memory Management & Garbage Collection

Long single-page experiences can accumulate if you don't clean up: - We covered using `ScrollTrigger.getAll().forEach(t=> t.kill())` on navigation. Also consider killing tweens that are no longer needed. GSAP typically releases tweens after completion and after no references to them exist. But if you store timeline in a variable and never kill it, it will persist (though idle). - Use GSAP Context or `tl.kill()` on old timelines when moving off a section or destroying a component. This frees associated events and memory. - Avoid creating an excessive number of tweens over time without cleanup. E.g., if on every mousemove you create a tween and don't kill the old one, you might pile up thousands. Use quickTo or overwrite strategies (`overwrite: 'auto'` will kill previous tweens on same target automatically). - **GSAP's internal pool:** GSAP reuses objects for performance, but GC can still be an issue if you spawn tons of new objects rapidly. If you find memory creeping up, it might be either not killing triggers or just the nature of having many elements in DOM. Removing elements that are offscreen or done (or reusing them) can help. - Check for detached DOM nodes: after using Flip or similar, ensure you didn't accidentally duplicate DOM that never gets removed. Use memory snapshot in DevTools to see if lots of elements linger after supposed removal.
