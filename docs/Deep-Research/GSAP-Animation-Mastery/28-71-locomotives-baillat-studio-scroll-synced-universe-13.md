### 7.1 Locomotive's Baillat Studio -- Scroll-synced Universe [\[13\]](https://www.awwwards.com/case-study-baillat-studio-by-locomotive.html#:~:text=An%20advanced%20scroll,duration%20for%20each%20of%20them)

**Background:** Locomotive (a Montreal agency) built an award-winning site for Baillat Studio. One highlight: an **advanced scroll-related animation** allows the user to *"dive into Baillat's universe"*, syncing their custom smooth scroll with a GSAP timeline[\[13\]](https://www.awwwards.com/case-study-baillat-studio-by-locomotive.html#:~:text=An%20advanced%20scroll,duration%20for%20each%20of%20them).

**What they did:** - They used **Locomotive Scroll** (a smooth scrolling library) combined with **GSAP ScrollTrigger** to choreograph animations as the user scrolls. The smooth scroll was proxied into ScrollTrigger so that everything remained in sync. - The site had two "worlds" (black on white vs white on black sections) and as you scrolled, transitions (like color inversion, content reveals) happened at precise scroll points. GSAP timelines with ScrollTrigger likely orchestrated these multi-step changes. - Quote from case: "synced Locomotive Scroll's smoothness with a GSAP timeline... to manage multiple keypoint transitions with custom easings and durations"[\[13\]](https://www.awwwards.com/case-study-baillat-studio-by-locomotive.html#:~:text=An%20advanced%20scroll,duration%20for%20each%20of%20them). This implies they perhaps created a master timeline with sections of animation (keypoints) and tied it to scroll progress (scrub). - The complexity here was high, but by breaking it into modules (smooth scroll handling, timeline for animations), they achieved a seamless story as you scroll.

**Key Takeaways:** - Combining smooth scrolling and GSAP is a common pattern for top-tier sites (Active Theory, Locomotive, etc.). Now, with ScrollSmoother (which did not exist at the time of that project likely), it's easier for us to replicate such effects natively. - They emphasize *multiple keypoint transitions* -- meaning not just one effect but many (perhaps text changes, images morphing, background color flips) all controlled via a single timeline. This is effectively a scroll-driven storytelling scene. - Locomotive had their boilerplate and LocomotiveScroll library, but the principle for AI: use ScrollTrigger with `scrollerProxy` or ScrollSmoother to integrate any smooth scroll. Then build a timeline with labels or sections for each "scene" in the scroll journey.

**How to achieve similar:** - Use `ScrollTrigger.create({ animation: masterTimeline, scrub: true, start: "top top", end: "bottom bottom" })` for the whole section. - Break the masterTimeline into segments. For example, label "scene1End" when first transition done, etc., and use `tl.addLabel()` or timelines inside. - Use `ScrollTrigger.addEventListener("refresh", ... )` if needed to sync Locomotive scroll updates if using external library (but ScrollTrigger's scrollerProxy covers most). - Pay attention to performance: pinning large sections and animating large backgrounds -- likely they optimized (like only animating colors and transforms).

**Result:** The user scrolls and feels like they are navigating two parallel worlds with smooth transitions -- a "WOW" effect created by technical sync of scroll and animation. It demonstrates the power of GSAP for narrative experiences.
