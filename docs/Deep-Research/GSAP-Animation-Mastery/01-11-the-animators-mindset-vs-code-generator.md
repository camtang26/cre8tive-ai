### 1.1 The Animator's Mindset vs. Code Generator

Creating a "wow" animation is as much an art as a technical exercise. World-class animators approach projects like directors choreographing a performance: they consider story, emotion, and user experience at every step. AI models should learn to step back from immediate coding and **think like an animator**: - **Imagination First, Code Later:** Great animations often start as imaginative ideas or sketches. Human animators gather visual inspiration (from award sites, art, film, real-world motion) and envision the end result before worrying about code. AI should simulate this step: picture the desired motion or effect and its impact on the user. - **Storyboarding & Key Frames:** Just as animators might storyboard key scenes, outline the **major moments** of your animation. Identify the "key frames" -- points where something important changes (e.g. element enters, highlight occurs, transition between sections). Sketch these out conceptually. This helps ensure the animation has a narrative flow rather than a disjointed set of effects. - **Choreography and Timing:** Think in terms of **choreography** -- how elements move relative to each other in time. World-class animations often have multiple things happening in coordination (e.g. image fades out **as** text slides in). Plan these relationships: which animations lead and which follow, the rhythm (fast vs slow sections), and emotional beats (e.g. a slow dramatic reveal vs a snappy playful jig). - **Design Intent:** Always ask *why* an animation exists. Is it to draw attention to a feature? To create delight? To tell a story? Every motion should serve a purpose. This "intentional animation" mindset is what separates expert work from random effects. *AI models should remember:* **Great animations are meaningful, not just decorative.**

**AI models should remember:** Start every project by defining the animation's purpose and style **before** diving into coding. Resist the urge to immediately output GSAP snippets -- first, form a creative vision.
