## Critical Findings & Fixes

### üî• Memory Leak Risks ELIMINATED

**Before Sprint:**
- Story 1.6: Canvas RAF loop - NO cleanup AC
- Story 1.8: GSAP animations - NO cleanup AC
- Story 1.9: GSAP stagger - NO cleanup AC

**After Sprint:**
- ‚úÖ Story 1.6: AC9 added (`cancelAnimationFrame()` + particle cleanup)
- ‚úÖ Story 1.8: AC7 added (`gsap.context()` cleanup)
- ‚úÖ Story 1.9: AC8 added (`gsap.context()` cleanup)

**Impact:**
- Prevents browser crashes from orphaned animation loops

- Prevents performance degradation from unmounted ScrollTriggers

### üèóÔ∏è Foundation Story Context Added

**Story 1.1 (Foundation):**
- Was DONE (QA approved) but had NO architecture references
- Devs installed GSAP/Lenis without understanding patterns
- NOW has comprehensive library decision tree and integration patterns
- Future devs will understand WHY and HOW from the start

### ‚úÖ Validation Story Standards Established

**Story 1.11 (Validation):**
- Had ACs but NO architecture standards to validate against
- NOW references ALL architecture docs as validation checkpoint
- Includes cleanup validation checklist for all 7 animation stories
- QA has clear standards to test against

## Pattern Consistency

### useGSAP vs Vanilla Pattern

**Identified in:**
- Story 1.7 (addressed in previous sprint)
- Story 1.8 (addressed in this sprint)

**Resolution:**
- Pattern note added to both stories
- Recommends vanilla `useEffect` + `gsap.context()` for project consistency
- Acknowledges both patterns provide cleanup
- Devs can choose, but know project standard

**Outcome:** Pattern inconsistency documented, devs guided to correct approach
