## Recommendations

### Must Fix
None.

### Should Improve
None. Context is production-ready for Dev Agent.

### Consider
1. **Future Enhancement:** When automated tests are added to the project, update `<tests><locations>` section to reference actual test file paths.
2. **Tech Spec Link:** If Epic 1 tech spec is created (tech-spec-epic-1.md), add reference to `<docs>` section for architectural context.
