**Issue:** Foundation story but no architecture references
**Recommended Addition:**
- Architecture References section
- Reference animation-patterns.md introduction (lines 1-60)
- Reference Lenis Integration section (lines 338-361)
- Link to frontend-architecture.md Animation Stack (Section 6)

**Priority:** HIGH (foundation story, sets patterns for all others)

---

#### Story 1.2: Color Palette & Hero/CTA
**Scope:** Create palette.ts, BriefingHero, BriefingCTA
**Issue:** No architecture references
**Recommended Addition:**
- Architecture References section

- Note Framer Motion usage for hero micro-interactions

**Priority:** MEDIUM (palette already created, references would help consistency)

---

#### Story 1.4: Storyboard Dividers
**Scope:** Create StoryboardDivider component
**Issue:** No architecture references
**Assessment:** Likely a simple presentational component, may not need heavy architecture refs
**Recommended Addition (if animations used):**
- If component has animations: reference animation-patterns.md
- If static: reference frontend-architecture.md Component Design Template

**Priority:** LOW (simple component, minimal risk)

---

#### Story 1.6: Canvas Particles AI Visualization
**Scope:** Premium particle effects for "AI processing" stage
**Issue:** No architecture references for canvas/animation patterns
**Recommended Addition:**
- Architecture References section
- Reference animation-patterns.md Performance Optimization (Section 8)
- Reference GPU acceleration patterns (will-change, transform)
- Note cleanup requirements for canvas/animation frames

**Priority:** HIGH (complex animation, memory leak risk without cleanup)

---

#### Story 1.8: Workflow Transformation Comparison
**Scope:** Traditional vs AI workflow visualization
**Issue:** No architecture references
**Recommended Addition:**
- Architecture References section
- Reference animation-patterns.md (likely Pattern 2 Scrub or Pattern 5 Timeline)
- React cleanup AC (if GSAP used)
- Performance patterns for comparison animations

**Priority:** MEDIUM (visualization component, may have animations)

---

#### Story 1.9: Audience Benefits (Agency vs Brands)
**Scope:** Benefits showcase with storyboard frame aesthetic

**Issue:** No architecture references
**Recommended Addition:**
- Architecture References section
- Reference animation-patterns.md Accessibility (Section 9)
- Reference frontend-architecture.md Performance (Section 5)
- Reference WCAG patterns (though user said "don't prioritize WCAG")

**Priority:** HIGH (validation story, should reference all architecture standards)

---

#### Story 1.12: Testing & Deployment
**Scope:** Cross-browser testing, deployment validation
**Issue:** No architecture references
**Assessment:** Testing story, likely doesn't need architecture patterns
**Recommended Addition (optional):**
- Reference frontend-architecture.md Testing section (when created)
- Reference build/deployment patterns

**Priority:** LOW (operational story, minimal architecture impact)

---

## Critical Findings

### 1. Memory Leak Risk (Stories 1.6, 1.8, 1.9)
**Issue:** 3 animation-heavy stories have no cleanup AC requirements
**Impact:** Potential memory leaks from GSAP, canvas animations, or RAF loops
**Recommendation:** Add React cleanup AC to all animation stories

### 2. Foundation Story Gap (Story 1.1)
**Issue:** Installation story has no architecture references
**Impact:** Devs don't know WHY these libraries or HOW they fit together
**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive architecture references to Story 1.1

### 3. Pattern Inconsistency (Story 1.7 addressed)
**Issue:** Story 1.7 showed `useGSAP` hook but architecture uses vanilla `useEffect`
**Resolution:** ✅ Added pattern note explaining discrepancy and recommending vanilla pattern
**Action:** Monitor other stories for similar inconsistencies

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Story 1.1:** Add architecture references (foundation story)
2. **Story 1.6:** Add cleanup AC + architecture references (memory leak risk)
3. **Story 1.11:** Add architecture references (validation story)

### Short-Term Actions (Medium Priority)
4. **Story 1.2:** Add architecture references (palette consistency)
5. **Story 1.8:** Add cleanup AC + architecture references (if animated)
6. **Story 1.9:** Add cleanup AC + architecture references (if animated)

### Optional Actions (Low Priority)
7. **Story 1.4:** Review if architecture references needed
8. **Story 1.12:** Review if architecture references needed

## Success Metrics

### Current Alignment Rate
- **Architecture References:** 4/12 (33%)
- **Cleanup Patterns:** 4/12 (33%)

### Target Alignment Rate (After Recommendations)
- **Architecture References:** 10/12 (83%) *(excluding 1.4, 1.12)*
- **Cleanup Patterns:** 7/12 (58%) *(excluding non-animation stories)*

## Next Steps

**Option A: Continue Architecture Alignment** (Recommended)
- Update Story 1.1, 1.6, 1.11 with architecture references (HIGH priority)
- Add cleanup ACs to Stories 1.6, 1.8, 1.9
- Update STORY-ALIGNMENT-REPORT.md with findings

**Option B: Proceed to Implementation**
- Accept current 33% alignment rate
- Address architecture gaps during implementation reviews
- Risk: Devs may miss patterns, create inconsistent code

**Option C: Hybrid Approach**
- Complete HIGH priority stories (1.1, 1.6, 1.11) now
- Address MEDIUM priority stories during implementation
- LOW priority stories reviewed in retrospective

## Conclusion

**Current State:**
Epic 1 has 4/12 stories fully aligned with architecture (33%). This is a solid foundation but leaves 8 stories without architecture references, creating risk of pattern inconsistency and memory leaks.

**Recommended Path:**
Complete HIGH priority architecture alignment (Stories 1.1, 1.6, 1.11) before implementation begins. This ensures foundation patterns are documented and memory leak risks are mitigated.

**Estimated Effort:**
- HIGH priority updates: 2 hours (3 stories)
- MEDIUM priority updates: 1.5 hours (3 stories)
- Total to 83% alignment: 3.5 hours

**Risk if Not Addressed:**
- Inconsistent animation patterns across components
- Memory leaks from missing cleanup (Stories 1.6, 1.8, 1.9)
- Devs reinventing patterns already documented
- Tech debt accumulation requiring later refactor
