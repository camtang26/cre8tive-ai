## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** web (Web Application)
- **Project Level:** TBD (to be determined in Phase 2)
- **Instruction Set:** To be determined based on project level
- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** brownfield

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Existing web application codebase requiring enhancement/modification
- **Estimated Stories:** TBD (to be determined after documentation and planning)
- **Estimated Epics:** TBD (to be determined in Phase 2)
- **Timeline:** TBD

### Context

- **Existing Documentation:** Partial - some docs exist but incomplete
- **UI Components:** Yes - project includes user-facing interface elements
- **Documentation Needed:** Yes - codebase documentation required before planning
- **UX Workflow Required:** Yes - included in Phase 2 after PRD

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

**Phase 1 - Analysis:**
1. Brownfield Codebase Documentation (document-project workflow)
   - Architecture overview
   - Code structure and patterns
   - Technical debt assessment
   - API/integration documentation

**Phase 2 - Planning:**
1. PRD/GDD/Tech-Spec (plan-project workflow)
   - Requirements and scope definition
   - Project level determination (0-4)
   - Epic and story breakdown
2. UX Specification (ux-spec workflow)
   - User flows and journey maps
   - Wireframes and mockups
   - Component specifications

**Phase 3 - Solutioning (if Level 3-4):**
1. Solution Architecture (conditional on project level)
2. Epic-specific Tech Specs (JIT)

**Phase 4 - Implementation:**
1. Iterative story development
2. Quality gates and approvals
3. Progressive delivery

### Workflow Sequence

1. ✅ **workflow-status** (Analyst) - Complete
2. ⏭️ **document-project** (Analyst) - NEXT ACTION
3. **plan-project** (PM) - Determines project level
4. **ux-spec** (PM) - UI/UX specification
5. **Phase 3 workflows** (Architect) - If Level 3-4 required
6. **create-story → story-ready → story-context → dev-story → story-approved** (SM/DEV) - Iterative implementation cycle

### Next Actions

**Immediate:** Run `document-project` workflow with Analyst agent to generate comprehensive brownfield documentation.

**After Documentation:** Run `plan-project` workflow with PM agent to create PRD and determine final project level.

## Special Considerations

- **Brownfield Context:** Documentation phase is critical for understanding existing patterns, technical debt, and architectural constraints
- **Level Determination Deferred:** Project level (0-4) will be determined during Phase 2 planning, which dictates whether Phase 3 (Solutioning) is required
- **UX Workflow Included:** Since project has UI components, UX specification workflow is mandatory in Phase 2
- **Conditional Phase 3:** Solutioning phase (architecture + tech specs) only required if project is Level 3 or 4

## Technical Preferences Captured

_To be populated during planning phase_

## Story Naming Convention

### Level TBD

Story naming convention will be established after project level is determined in Phase 2.

**Potential formats:**
- **Level 0:** `story-<short-title>.md`
- **Level 1:** `story-<title>-<n>.md`
- **Level 2+:** `story-<epic>.<story>.md`

**Location:** `docs/stories/` (per project config)

## Decision Log

### Planning Decisions Made

- **2025-10-16**: Project classified as brownfield web application with partial documentation
- **2025-10-16**: Documentation workflow (document-project) added as first step due to incomplete existing docs
- **2025-10-16**: UX specification workflow required due to presence of UI components
- **2025-10-16**: Project level determination deferred to Phase 2 (plan-project workflow)
- **2025-10-16**: Manual workflow selection chosen (Option C) - user will select workflows as needed
- **2025-10-16**: Completed document-project workflow (initial_scan mode, deep scan). Generated 6 documentation files in docs/. Next: plan-project (PM agent)
