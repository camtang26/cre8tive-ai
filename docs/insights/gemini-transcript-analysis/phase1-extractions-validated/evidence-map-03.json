So if I go and make an image right now, I'll be in one of the latest image models and animate it. There's a very high chance that that shot, even if the shots look relatively the same, that the updated image or the more up-to-date image get animated better with the video tech. So this is something that I have a theory on this is that obviously, at the end of the day, all the images that we have, you know, that you make with AI are just a whole lot of pixels formed or like combined in a specific way to make the image. I have a theory that the pixel formation of the older AI images with the more with the older tech must be so different from the latest images that it causes them to not be animated as well by the latest video tech.",
