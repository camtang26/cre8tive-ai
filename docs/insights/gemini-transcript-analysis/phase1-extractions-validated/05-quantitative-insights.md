## Evidence Legend

**SOURCE CODES (Critical for all metrics):**
- **[T]** = Transcript-sourced (qualitative evidence found, may need quantification)
- **[PA-PENDING]** = Product Analytics needed (requires platform data/tracking)
- **[IND-PENDING]** = Industry benchmark needed (requires external citation)
- **[A-EST]** = Analyst estimate (calculation methodology required)
- **[UNVERIFIABLE]** = Removed (insufficient evidence or calculation errors)

**EVIDENCE STRENGTH:**
- **VALIDATED** = High-confidence, directly stated in source (0 metrics)
- **INFERRED** = Supported qualitatively, needs quantification (4 metrics)
- **STRATEGIC** = No source evidence, requires verification (35 metrics)

**VALIDATION PRIORITIES:**
1. Product Analytics (12 metrics) - Highest priority for credibility
2. Analyst Estimates (4 metrics) - Need methodology documentation
3. Industry Benchmarks (3 metrics) - Need citations
4. Transcript quantification (4 metrics) - Convert qualitative to quantitative

## CRITICAL DATA GAPS

**WARNING:** This document contains 28 metrics with the following validation status:
- **0 metrics (0%)** are fully validated
- **4 metrics (14%)** have qualitative transcript support [T] but lack precise quantification
- **12 metrics (43%)** require product analytics data [PA-PENDING]
- **8 metrics (29%)** are analyst estimates [A-EST] requiring methodology documentation
