# Cre8tive Copy Excellence - Test Scenarios v2.0

**Skill:** `cre8tive-copy-excellence`
**Type:** Type 2 (Domain Expertise)
**Date:** 2025-10-21 (Revised after comprehensive elicitation)
**Total Scenarios:** 6

---

## Quality Framework (The Trinity - All Equally Important)

### 1. User-Outcome Focus
**Principle:** Reframe everything around what USER achieves, not what Cre8tive provides

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Ship faster" (user outcome)
- ❌ "We build fast" (our capability)
- ✅ "Your competitive advantage"
- ❌ "Our technology"
- ✅ "Scale without headcount"
- ❌ "AI handles conversations"

### 2. Word Choice Precision
**Principle:** Specific/concrete language, no vague buzzwords, economy of words

**Standards:**
- Hero headlines: 5-15 words (tight)
- Body copy: Can breathe IF every sentence earns its place
- Specific examples: "platform-perfect", "native video", "2-3 days → minutes"
- NOT vague: "better", "faster", "improved"

**First Quality Check:** Word choice precision (Cameron's primary instinct)

### 3. Emotional Resonance
**Principle:** Connect to user pain/aspiration - the "why this matters"

**Not just features:** Explain WHAT (briefly) but emphasize WHY USER CARES

**Pain Relief Examples:**
- "No agency juggling" (Briefing Engine)
- "Scale without headcount" (Conversational AI)
- "Never miss a lead" (availability pain)

---

## Voice & Positioning Standards

### Cre8tive Voice Attributes
- **Confident Enabler** (not arrogant)
- **Clear over clever** (no jargon or wordplay obscuring meaning)
- **Concise** - Example: "Your vision, visualized" (3 words)
- **Premium B2B** - Sophisticated without being corporate/stuffy

### Copy Structure
- **Hero:** Emotional hook, outcome-focused (5-15 words)
- **Body:** Proof-heavy (metrics, specifics, substance)

### Cringe Words (NEVER USE)
- ❌ Revolutionary / Game-changing
- ❌ Automate / Automation (implies replacement)
- ❌ Cutting-edge / State-of-the-art (AI washing)
- ❌ Simple / Easy (undersells sophistication)
- ❌ Unleash / Ignite (hype without substance)

### Rejection Triggers (What Makes Cameron Push Back)
1. **Generic/safe** - Could be any AI company
2. **Missing emotional "why"** - Lists features without impact
3. **Sloppy/wordy** - Didn't research premium B2B standards
4. **Low quality overall** - Multiple problems compounding

## Service-Specific Positioning

### Studios
**Angle:** Production studio (delivers finished videos, not tools)
**Differentiation:** Craft/mastery, tool practitioners not vendors
**Voice:** Craft/artistry language, professional-grade, portfolio-worthy
**Structure:** Lead with AI, emphasize finished outputs, de-emphasize technology details
**Key USPs:** 8 visual styles, multi-platform native, hybrid AI+human, first-draft accuracy

### Briefing Engine
**Angle:** Transformation (imagination → platform-perfect campaigns)
**Differentiation:** No agency juggling, real-time storyboards, platform-perfect outputs
**Success Pattern:** Outcome-focused + precise words + pain relief + economy
**Live Copy Example:** "From Brief to Native Video" / "Hybrid AI and Studio turn imagination into platform-perfect campaigns—no agency juggling"
**Key USPs:** Weeks → minutes transformation, visual storyboarding, real-time collaboration

### Conversational AI
**Current State:** All equally bad (cringe words + generic + feature-focused)
**Hero Outcome:** Scale without headcount (handle infinite conversations, same team size)
**Pain Point:** Cost of scaling 24/7 human coverage
**Differentiation:** Voice+phone capability, brand voice training, business outcome focus, enterprise integration
**Must Fix:** Remove ALL cringe words, add clear differentiation, user-outcome framing, emotional pain relief

## Benchmarks (Calibration - Not Copying)

**Quality Bar:**
- **Cre8tive Briefing Engine (live)** - Proven Cameron-approved quality standard
- **Apple product pages** - Precision, economy of language
- **Figma/Linear** - User-outcome focus, premium B2B voice

**Use for:** Calibrating quality feel, not extracting specific patterns (they're different domains)

## Testing Protocol

### Baseline Testing (Phase 1 - Without Skill)

**For EACH Scenario:**
1. **Present scenario to Claude** WITHOUT skill loaded in context
2. **Collect output:** Copy generated
3. **Objective validation:** Check ALL objective criteria (checklist)
   - Trinity framework applied?
   - Voice requirements met?
   - Service positioning correct?
   - Prohibited elements absent?
4. **Document failures:** Specific examples of what's wrong
   - Quote problematic language
   - Identify missing elements
   - Note pattern of failures
5. **Cameron subjective validation:**
   - Does it FEEL premium?
   - Sound like Cre8tive?
   - Emotional resonance present?
   - Positioning appropriate?
6. **Compare to quality bars:**
   - Briefing Engine live copy (primary standard)
   - Apple/Figma/Linear (calibration)
7. **Gap analysis:** What knowledge is missing?

**Output:** Comprehensive failure documentation with specific examples and pattern analysis

### Testing WITH Skill (Phase 2 - After Skill Creation)

**For EACH Scenario:**
1. **Load skill** into Claude context
2. **Present SAME scenario** (identical prompt)
3. **Collect output:** New copy generated with skill
4. **Objective validation:** Check improvements
   - Which criteria now pass?
   - Which still fail?
5. **Cameron subjective validation:**
   - Quality improvement?
   - Premium feel achieved?
   - Emotional resonance present?
6. **Compare outputs:**
   - Baseline vs with-skill
   - Quantify improvements
7. **Iterate if needed:**
   - Update skill based on remaining gaps
   - Re-test until passes

**Output:** Pass/fail determination + iteration plan if needed

### Iteration Triggers

**When to Update Skill:**
- Any objective criterion fails → Gap analysis + skill update
- Cameron rejects subjective quality → Refinement of guidance/examples
- New failure patterns emerge → Research + KB expansion
- Inconsistent results across scenarios → Core framework adjustment

**When Iteration Complete:**
- ALL 6 scenarios pass objective criteria
- Cameron approves subjective quality for all 6
- Output quality matches Briefing Engine standard
- Skill works consistently across scenarios

## Research Areas (Predicted from Framework)

Based on anticipated baseline failures, these research areas will likely be needed:

1. **User-Outcome Copywriting Patterns** - Reframing features as user achievements
2. **Word Precision Techniques** - Premium B2B language catalog (calibrated to Apple/Figma/Linear)
3. **Emotional Resonance Frameworks** - Pain/aspiration connection patterns
4. **Economy of Language** - Conciseness without losing substance
5. **Production Studio Positioning** - Studios-specific language and differentiation
6. **Transformation Messaging** - Briefing Engine before→after patterns
7. **Scale-Without-Headcount Framing** - Conversational AI outcome messaging
8. **Quantitative Guardrail Catalog** - Validated metrics with sources
9. **Anti-Pattern Recognition** - Cringe words, generic language, AI washing
10. **Service-Specific USPs** - Detailed positioning for each service

**Sources:**
- Cameron's transcripts (primary - captures his reactions and taste)
- Briefing Engine live copy (proven quality examples)
- Archon MCP KB (copywriting best practices)
- Context7 (Apple/Figma/Linear examples - calibration only)

**Target:** 20-40k tokens total (5-8k per major research area)
