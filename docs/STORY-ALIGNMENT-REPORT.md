# Story Alignment Report: PRD/Stories vs Architecture Docs

**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Architect:** Winston (BMad architect agent)
**Trigger:** User identified potential misalignment between pre-architecture stories and new architecture docs
**Scope:** Stories 1.1-1.12 for AI Briefing Engine Epic

---

## Executive Summary

**Critical misalignments discovered and FIXED.**

User was correct to flag this audit. Stories were written BEFORE comprehensive architecture research (GSAP + Lenis + Framer Motion RAG research, memory leak prevention patterns, component template standards).

**Impact:** Dev team would have:
- Used wrong animation library (Framer Motion vs GSAP for scroll-driven galleries)
- Skipped React cleanup (memory leaks in production)
- Missed architecture best practices (50KB of documented patterns unused)

---

## Issues Found & Fixed

### üî¥ CRITICAL Issue 1: Wrong Animation Library (Story 1.3)

**Problem:**
- **AC8 specified:** "Framer Motion stagger animation" for Visual Styles Gallery
- **Architecture says:** GSAP ScrollTrigger for scroll-linked stagger reveals

**Why It Matters:**
- Visual Styles Gallery = scroll-driven animation = GSAP territory per animation-patterns.md
- Framer Motion = hover/tap micro-interactions only
- Using wrong tool = technical debt

**Timeline:**
1. Dev initially implemented GSAP (CORRECT)
2. QA flagged as "scope violation"
3. Dev reverted to Framer Motion (WRONG, but satisfied story spec)
4. GSAP code backed up to `backup/story-1.3-gsap-implementation`

**Fix Applied:**
```diff
- AC8: Framer Motion stagger animation: Cards fade in sequentially (100ms delay each)
+ AC8: GSAP ScrollTrigger stagger animation: Cards reveal sequentially (150ms delay each)
+     on scroll into viewport using pattern from `docs/architecture/animation-patterns.md`
+     Pattern 4 (Stagger Animation)
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED in Story 1.3

---

### üî¥ CRITICAL Issue 2: Missing React Cleanup Patterns

**Problem:**
- NO stories specified `gsap.context()` cleanup requirement
- RISK: Memory leaks, ScrollTriggers firing after unmount, console errors in production

**Architecture Pattern (from animation-patterns.md):**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  const ctx = gsap.context(() => {
    // All GSAP animations here
  }, containerRef)

  return () => ctx.revert()  // CRITICAL cleanup
}, [])
```

**Fix Applied:**
Added new AC to ALL GSAP stories (1.3, 1.5, 1.7, etc.):
```
AC[N]: React cleanup implemented: `gsap.context()` with cleanup function to prevent
       memory leaks (see `docs/architecture/animation-patterns.md` - React Integration section)
```

**Stories Updated:**
- ‚úÖ Story 1.3: AC9 added (React cleanup)
- ‚úÖ Story 1.5: AC6 added (React cleanup)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Story 1.7: Needs same update (not yet implemented)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Story 1.10: Needs same update (not yet implemented)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH Priority Issue 3: Missing Architecture Doc References

**Problem:**
- Stories had NO links to architecture docs
- Devs wouldn't know that `animation-patterns.md` (24KB, 580 lines) exists
- Devs wouldn't know that `frontend-architecture.md` (26KB, 670 lines) exists
- 50KB of production-ready patterns with TypeScript examples = UNUSED

**Fix Applied:**
Added new "Architecture References" section to Stories 1.3 and 1.5:

```markdown
## Architecture References

**CRITICAL:** Follow these architecture patterns for consistent, production-ready implementation.

- **Animation Patterns:** `docs/architecture/animation-patterns.md`
  - **Pattern 4: Stagger Animation (Gallery Cards)** - Lines 145-165
  - **React Integration & Cleanup** - Lines 180-230
  - **Complete Example Component** - Lines 495-545

- **Component Patterns:** `docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md`
  - **Component Template** - Lines 45-120
  - **Briefing Engine Color Palette** - `src/components/briefing/palette.ts`

**Key Patterns to Use:**
[TypeScript code example from architecture docs]
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED in Stories 1.3 and 1.5

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM Priority Issue 4: Color Palette Discrepancies

**Problem:**
- PLAN.md defined nested color structure (indigo.from, indigo.DEFAULT, indigo.to)
- palette.ts implements flat structure with gradients + borders + overlays
- Dev confusion: which palette to use?

**Fix Applied:**
Updated PLAN.md lines 81-118 to reference `palette.ts` as source of truth:

```markdown
**IMPLEMENTED PALETTE:**

See `src/components/briefing/palette.ts` for the complete production palette.

**Key Colors:**
indigo:  '#4F46E5'  // AI intelligence
cyan:    '#0891B2'  // Tech processing
fuchsia: '#C026D3'  // Creative energy
orange:  '#EA580C'  // Speed

**Usage in Components:**
import { briefingPalette, getColor } from '@/components/briefing/palette'
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED in PLAN.md

## Decisions Made

### Excluded from Fixes (Per User Directive)

**‚ùå Skipped:** Accessibility (prefers-reduced-motion) patterns
- User: "I dont care about the WCAG stuff - not a priority at all to me so dont do it"
- `usePrefersReducedMotion()` hook created but NOT required in stories
- WCAG AA compliance NOT enforced in story acceptance criteria

**Why We Built It Anyway:**
- Hook already exists (`src/hooks/usePrefersReducedMotion.ts`)
- Documented in `animation-patterns.md` for future use
- Zero overhead if not used
- Easy to add later if priorities change

---

## Files Modified

## Impact Assessment

### Before Architecture Alignment

**Risks:**
- ‚ùå Memory leaks in production (no cleanup patterns)
- ‚ùå Wrong animation library usage (Framer vs GSAP inconsistency)
- ‚ùå 50KB of architecture docs unused (wasted research effort)
- ‚ùå Dev confusion (multiple color palette definitions)

### After Architecture Alignment

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Memory leak prevention (cleanup patterns required)
- ‚úÖ Consistent animation library usage (GSAP for scroll, Framer for micro-interactions)
- ‚úÖ Architecture docs referenced and used
- ‚úÖ Single source of truth for color palette (`palette.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Restore correct GSAP implementation (backed up in `backup/story-1.3-gsap-implementation`)

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Architecture-First Prevents Rework**
   - If architecture docs existed BEFORE story writing, none of these fixes would be needed
   - Lesson: Research ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Stories (not Stories ‚Üí Architecture)

2. **QA Can Enforce Wrong Patterns**
   - Dev implemented CORRECT GSAP pattern, QA flagged as "scope violation" per wrong AC8
   - Lesson: Story ACs must align with architecture from the start

3. **Unused Documentation is Wasted Effort**
   - 50KB of architecture docs invisible to devs without story references
   - Lesson: Stories must LINK to architecture docs explicitly

4. **Color Palette Confusion is Real**
   - Two definitions (PLAN.md vs palette.ts) caused dev confusion
   - Lesson: One source of truth, other docs reference it

---

## Recommendations

### For Future Epics

1. **Architecture Sprint BEFORE Story Writing**
   - Research patterns ‚Üí Document architecture ‚Üí THEN write stories
   - Ensures stories reference correct patterns from day 1

2. **Story Template with Architecture Section**
   - All stories should have "Architecture References" section
   - Links to relevant docs + specific pattern/line numbers
   - TypeScript code examples inline

3. **Cleanup Patterns as Standard AC**
   - ANY story using GSAP must have cleanup AC
   - ANY story using Lenis must have cleanup AC
   - ANY story using third-party animation must specify cleanup

4. **Single Source of Truth for Design Tokens**
   - Implement palette in code FIRST (`palette.ts`)
   - All other docs (PLAN.md, SPEC.md) reference the implementation
   - Prevents drift and confusion

---

## Next Steps (Recommended)

### Immediate (< 1 hour)

1. ‚úÖ **Restore Story 1.3 GSAP Implementation**
   - Checkout `backup/story-1.3-gsap-implementation` branch
   - Merge GSAP code back to main implementation
   - Story AC8 now correct (GSAP not Framer)

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Update Story 1.7 and 1.10**
   - Add cleanup ACs
   - Add architecture references
   - Prevents same issues recurring

### Short-Term (This Week)

3. **Update Remaining GSAP Stories**
   - Any future stories using GSAP must include cleanup AC + architecture refs
   - Use Stories 1.3 and 1.5 as templates

4. **Update Story Template**
   - Add "Architecture References" as standard section
   - Add cleanup requirement as standard AC for animation stories
