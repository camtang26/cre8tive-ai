# Code Quality Assessment
code_quality:
  architecture: "Clean separation, standalone component, proper React hooks pattern"
  typescript: "Strong typing with Particle interface, no implicit any"
  patterns: "Follows frontend-architecture.md standards, GPU acceleration, RAF cleanup"
  documentation: "Comprehensive JSDoc added by QA, inline comments for complex physics"
  best_practices: "Uses palette.ts for colors, custom hooks, native APIs (no dependencies)"

# QA Refactoring Performed
refactoring:
  - file: "src/components/briefing/AIProcessingVisual.tsx"
    changes:
      - "Added comprehensive JSDoc comment block (26 lines) following frontend-architecture.md template"
      - "Extracted 14 magic numbers to named constants for maintainability"
      - "Added inline comments for complex orbital physics calculations"
      - "Added ARIA accessibility attributes (role='img', aria-label)"
    rationale: "Aligns with project coding standards, improves maintainability and accessibility"
    impact: "No functional changes, improves code quality and a11y compliance"

# Review Summary
summary: |
  Excellent implementation of Canvas particle animation with orbital physics.
  All 9 acceptance criteria met with evidence. Code quality is high with proper:
  - React patterns (hooks, refs, cleanup)
  - Performance optimization (60fps target, mobile, GPU, fallback)
  - Accessibility (prefers-reduced-motion, ARIA labels)
  - TypeScript typing (Particle interface)
  - Architecture compliance (palette.ts colors, native APIs)

  QA improvements made:
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation (aligns with frontend-architecture.md)
  - 14 magic numbers extracted to named constants (maintainability)
  - Inline physics comments (F = ma, centripetal force explanations)
  - ARIA labels for screen readers (role="img", descriptive label)

  Build: ✅ PASS (31.82s)
  Lint: ✅ PASS (0 errors, 11 pre-existing warnings)

  No blocking issues. Ready for production.
