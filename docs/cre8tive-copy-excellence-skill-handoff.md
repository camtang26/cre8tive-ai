**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Session Status:** GREEN Phase Ready (Post-Baseline, Pre-Skill Creation)
**Token Usage:** 173k/200k (saved for fresh skill creation)
**Next Step:** Create SKILL.md + KB reference files

---

## Executive Summary

We're creating a **Type 2 (Domain Expertise) Claude Skill** called `cre8tive-copy-excellence` to teach Claude how to write premium B2B copy for Cre8tive AI services.

**Progress:**
- ✅ Phase 0: Comprehensive elicitation (Cameron's quality framework captured)
- ✅ RED Phase: TRUE baseline testing (6 scenarios, no file access)
- ⏸️ GREEN Phase: Ready to create skill from baseline failures
- ⏳ Pending: Test with skill, iterate, deploy

**Critical Discovery:** Initial baseline tests were contaminated (subagents accessed codebase). Re-ran with file access restrictions. TRUE baseline failures documented below.

---

## The Trinity Framework (Cameron's Quality Standards)

### All Three EQUALLY Important (Must Work Together):

**1. User-Outcome Focus**
- **Principle:** Reframe everything around what USER achieves, not what Cre8tive provides
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ "Ship faster" (user outcome)
  - ❌ "We build fast" (our capability)
  - ✅ "Scale without headcount"
  - ❌ "AI handles conversations"

**2. Word Choice Precision**
- **Principle:** Specific/concrete language, no vague buzzwords, economy of words
- **Cameron's PRIMARY quality check** (first instinct)
- **Standards:**
  - Hero headlines: 5-15 words (tight)
  - Body: Can breathe IF every sentence earns its place
  - Specific examples: "platform-perfect", "native video", "2-3 days → minutes"
  - NOT vague: "better", "faster", "improved"

**3. Emotional Resonance**
- **Principle:** Connect to user pain/aspiration - the "why this matters"
- **NOT just features** - Explain WHAT briefly but emphasize WHY USER CARES
- **Pain Relief Examples:**
  - "No agency juggling" (Briefing Engine)
  - "Scale without headcount" (Conversational AI)

---

## Cameron's Voice & Positioning Requirements

### Cre8tive Voice Attributes:
- **Confident Enabler** (not arrogant)
- **Clear over clever** (no jargon obscuring meaning)
- **Concise** - Example: "Your vision, visualized" (3 words)
- **Premium B2B** - Sophisticated without corporate/stuffy

### Copy Structure:
- **Hero:** Emotional hook, outcome-focused (5-15 words)
- **Body:** Proof-heavy (metrics, specifics, substance)

### Cringe Words (NEVER USE):
- ❌ Revolutionary / Game-changing
- ❌ Automate / Automation (implies replacement)
- ❌ Cutting-edge / State-of-the-art (AI washing)
- ❌ Simple / Easy (undersells sophistication)
- ❌ Unleash / Ignite (hype without substance)

### Rejection Triggers (What Makes Cameron Push Back):
1. **Generic/safe** - Could be any AI company
2. **Missing emotional "why"** - Lists features without impact
3. **Sloppy/wordy** - Didn't research premium B2B standards
4. **Low quality overall** - Multiple problems compounding

---

## Service-Specific Positioning (CRITICAL)

### Studios
**Angle:** Production studio (delivers finished videos, NOT tools)
**Differentiation:** Craft/mastery, tool practitioners not vendors
**Voice:** Craft/artistry language, professional-grade, portfolio-worthy
**Structure:** Lead with AI, emphasize finished outputs, de-emphasize technology details
**Key USPs:** 8 visual styles, multi-platform native, hybrid AI+human, first-draft accuracy

**Cameron's Explicit Requirements:**
- "We're the production studio" - Tool vendors sell software, Cre8tive delivers finished videos
- "Mastery of tools to create FULL outputs" - Most AI media businesses make tools, we've mastered tools to create final outputs
- **Lead with AI** (not de-emphasize AI entirely)
- **De-emphasize technology details** (not the focus)
- **Craft/artistry language required**

### Briefing Engine
**Angle:** Transformation (imagination → platform-perfect campaigns)
**Differentiation:** No agency juggling, real-time storyboards, platform-perfect outputs
**Success Pattern:** Outcome-focused + precise words + pain relief + economy
**Live Copy Example (PROVEN QUALITY BAR):**
- "From Brief to Native Video"
- "Hybrid AI and Studio turn imagination into platform-perfect campaigns—no agency juggling"
**Key USPs:** Weeks → minutes transformation, visual storyboarding, real-time collaboration

**Critical Accuracy Guardrail:**
- ❌ "10-minute video production" (VIOLATION - videos take days)
- ✅ "10-minute storyboards" (correct - storyboards are fast)

### Conversational AI
**Current State:** All equally bad (cringe words + generic + feature-focused)
**Hero Outcome:** Scale without headcount (handle infinite conversations, same team size)
**Pain Point:** Cost of scaling 24/7 human coverage
**Differentiation:** Voice+phone capability, brand voice training, business outcome focus, enterprise integration
**Must Fix:** Remove ALL cringe words, add clear differentiation, user-outcome framing, emotional pain relief

**Cameron's Explicit Choices:**
- **Biggest problem:** All equally bad (cringe + generic + feature-focused)
- **Hero outcome:** Scale without headcount (NOT just 24/7 availability)
- **Pain point:** Cost of scaling
- **All 4 differentiators required:** Voice+phone, brand training, business outcomes, enterprise integration

---

## Benchmarks (Calibration - NOT Copying)

**Quality Bar:**
- **Cre8tive Briefing Engine (live)** - Proven Cameron-approved quality standard
- **Apple product pages** - Precision, economy of language
- **Figma/Linear** - User-outcome focus, premium B2B voice

**Use for:** Calibrating quality feel, not extracting specific patterns (different domains)

**Cameron's Direction:** "Use as calibration only" - Don't copy their patterns, they're not B2B AI

---

## Cameron's Elicitation Responses (Direct Quotes)

### Quality Framework Questions:

**Q: What's your FIRST instinct for judging quality?**
**A:** "Word choice precision"

**Q: Which copy example feels MOST like Cre8tive voice?**
**A:** "Your vision, visualized. Professional quality at AI speed."

**Q: What triggered pushback MOST often in transcripts?**
**A:** "Too generic/safe, Missing the 'why', Low quality overall - didnt research how premium B2B tech companies do it - didnt consider how many words, the impact, the delivery - just sloppy long and wordy cra"

**Q: What captures Cre8tive premium vs commodity?**
**A:** "Mastery OF using the tools to create full quality productions - most AI media businesses are the ones making the tools - our product is we've mastered the tools to create the FULL final outputs."

### Copy Structure Preferences:

**Q: Word count limits?**
**A:** "Hero: 5-15 words" (tight), "body can breathe IF every sentence earns its place"

**Q: Mastery of tools positioning - which framing?**
**A:** "We're the production studio" - Tool vendors sell software, we deliver finished videos

**Q: Briefing Engine - what makes it better?**
**A:** "you actually need to read whats on the page - not look at the transcripts"
- Outcome-focused language ("turn imagination into platform-perfect campaigns")
- Specific/precise words ("platform-perfect", "native video")
- Pain relief hook ("no agency juggling")
- Economy without sacrifice

### Copy Structure Rules:

**Q: Hero vs Body balance?**
**A:** "Hero emotional, body proof-heavy"

**Q: AI mention in Studios?**
**A:** "Lead with AI" (not de-emphasize entirely)

**Q: When to include metrics?**
**A:** "Hero emotional, body proof-heavy" - Metrics in body, not hero

## TRUE Baseline Testing Results (File Access Restricted)

### Method:
Spawned 6 subagents with EXPLICIT "do not access files" instruction. Self-contained prompts with minimal context ("Cre8tive AI does AI-powered video production").

### Critical Failures Discovered:

**Pattern 1: "Transform" Overuse**
- Used **5 TIMES** across 6 scenarios
- Scenarios 1, 3, 4, 5 all used it
- Clear crutch word that needs to be in banned list

**Pattern 2: "Automation" Language (Replacement Fear)**
- Used **3 TIMES** across scenarios
- "Harness intelligent automation" (Scenario 1)
- "efficiency of automation" (Scenario 2)
- "intelligent automation" (Scenario 5)
- **CRITICAL:** This triggers replacement fear objection

**Pattern 3: Accuracy Violations**
- Scenario 1: **"in minutes"** for VIDEO creation (should be storyboards only)
- Scenario 1: **"scale...without scaling...headcount"** on HOMEPAGE (that's Conversational AI's outcome, wrong service!)

**Pattern 4: AI Washing**
- "intelligent agents", "intelligent automation", "autonomous agents"
- Appears in Scenarios 4, 5

**Pattern 5: Budget Positioning (We're PREMIUM not cheap!)**
- Scenario 2: "without the agency price tag"
- **WRONG:** We're superior production model, not cheaper alternative

**Pattern 6: Wrong Studio Positioning**
- Scenario 2: "AI handles the technical heavy lifting" (undersells human craft)
- Scenario 2: "automation" language (should emphasize hybrid AI+human)
- Scenario 2: Tool/platform language, NOT production studio

**Pattern 7: Feature-Focused (Not User-Outcome)**
- Scenario 5: ALL 3 bullets use "Our [product] [verb]" structure
- 4/6 scenarios failed user-outcome framing

---

## Baseline Results by Scenario

### Scenario 1: Homepage Hero

**Output:**
```
H1: Create Professional Videos at the Speed of AI
Subheadline: Cre8tive AI transforms your ideas into studio-quality video content
in minutes, not weeks. Harness intelligent automation to scale your video strategy
without scaling your budget or headcount.
```

**Critical Failures:**
- ❌ "in minutes" - Implies VIDEOS in minutes (accuracy violation)
- ❌ "transforms" - Overused word
- ❌ "Harness intelligent automation" - Automation language
- ❌ "scale...without scaling...headcount" - Wrong service outcome (that's Conversational AI!)

**Missing:** Production studio, mastery, "Your vision", end-to-end platform, multi-platform native

---

### Scenario 2: Studios Service Page

**Output:**
```
Studios delivers a third way: AI-powered video production that combines the quality
of custom agency work with the speed and efficiency of automation.

Our AI handles the technical heavy lifting...

You bring the message. We bring broadcast-quality video production without the
agency price tag or timeline.
```

**Critical Failures:**
- ❌ "automation" - Prohibited word
- ❌ "AI handles the technical heavy lifting" - Wrong framing (should emphasize hybrid AI+human craft)
- ❌ "without the agency price tag" - Budget positioning (we're PREMIUM not cheap!)
- ❌ Tool/platform language - NOT production studio positioning

**Production Studio Positioning: COMPLETELY WRONG**
- Should be: "We deliver finished videos" (outcomes)
- Instead says: "Our AI handles" (tool/automation)

---

### Scenario 3: Briefing Engine Service Page

**Output:**
```
Transform your video production process with Briefing Engine, the AI-powered platform
that turns concepts into production-ready storyboards in minutes, not days...
```

**Failures:**
- ❌ "Transform" - Overused (3rd time in baseline)
- ❌ Missing "imagination → platform-perfect campaigns" transformation framing
- ❌ Missing "no agency juggling" pain relief

**Successes:**
- ✅ NO "10-minute video" claim - Correctly describes storyboards
- ✅ User-outcome framing present
- ✅ Word precision good

**Assessment:** Actually decent - just needs Cre8tive-specific overlay

---

### Scenario 4: Conversational AI Service Page

**Output:**
```
Transform every customer interaction into a revenue opportunity with intelligent agents
that understand context, not just keywords...

Our autonomous agents work 24/7...
```

**Critical Failures:**
- ❌ "Transform" - Overused (4TH TIME!)
- ❌ "intelligent agents", "autonomous agents" - AI washing
- ❌ MISSING hero outcome - No "scale without headcount"
- ❌ MISSING pain point - No "cost of scaling 24/7 coverage"
- ❌ Generic chatbot comparison - Not premium standalone

---

### Scenario 5: Value Prop / Why Cre8tive

**Output:**
```
1. Transform weeks of video production into days with AI-powered workflows...

2. Deliver studio-quality video content at scale without expanding your production team...

3. Stay ahead of competitors with conversational AI agents that streamline client
   briefings...
```

**Critical Failures:**
- ❌ "Transform" - FIFTH TIME!
- ❌ ALL bullets feature-focused - "AI-powered workflows", "intelligent automation", etc.
- ❌ Bullet 3 confused - Mixes conversational AI with briefing (WRONG!)
- ❌ Generic AI benefits - Could apply to anyone

**Missing USPs:** Production studio mastery, multi-platform native, hybrid craft, end-to-end platform, proof/trust

---

### Scenario 6: Technical Accuracy + Emotional Balance

**Output:**
```
Your brand deserves video content that moves as fast as your business. Imagine cutting
production timelines to a tenth of what you're used to—while halving your costs...

We've powered 200+ projects with an average rating of 4.8/5 stars, delivering production
speeds 10x faster than traditional agencies at 50% of the cost. Our AI-assisted workflow
achieves a 60% first-draft approval rate... 85% video completion rate...
```

**Assessment: EXCELLENT**
- ✅ Emotional hook opening
- ✅ ALL metrics from validated list
- ✅ Perfect quantitative guardrail compliance
- ✅ User-outcome framing
- ✅ Emotion + proof balance

**Minor Issues:**
- ⚠️ "That's the Cre8tive AI advantage" - Generic positioning
- ❌ Missing: Production studio angle, multi-platform native

**This proves baseline CAN do it when structure is clear!**

---

## Research Priorities (From TRUE Baseline)

### TIER 1 - CRITICAL (Every scenario needs):

**1. Anti-Pattern Recognition**
- "Transform" overuse (5 occurrences → banned)
- "Automation" language (3 occurrences → triggers replacement fear)
- AI washing ("intelligent agents/automation" → vague hype)
- Budget positioning (premium not cheap → "without price tag" banned)

**2. Production Studio Positioning**
- Delivers finished videos (NOT tools/automation)
- Craft/mastery emphasis
- Hybrid AI+human (NOT "AI handles heavy lifting")
- "You hire us for outcomes"
- 0/6 baseline scenarios got this right

**3. User-Outcome Framing**
- "YOU achieve X" not "AI does Y"
- Transformation framing (pain → relief)
- Ownership language ("YOUR vision")
- 4/6 scenarios failed this

**4. Accuracy Guardrails**
- Videos take days, storyboards take minutes
- Service boundaries clear (homepage ≠ Conversational AI outcome)
- No cross-contamination
- Baseline violated this (Scenario 1)

### TIER 2 - HIGH PRIORITY:

**5. Service-Specific Positioning**
- Studios: Production studio, craft, finished outputs
- Briefing Engine: Imagination → campaigns, pain relief
- Conversational AI: Scale without headcount, cost pain

**6. Cre8tive USPs**
- Multi-platform native (0/6 mentioned)
- 8 visual styles (mastered not templated)
- End-to-end platform
- Hybrid workflow specifics

### TIER 3 - REINFORCE (Already working):

**7. Word Precision** - Baseline did well, just maintain
**8. Quantitative Guardrail** - Scenario 6 proves it works when given metrics
**9. Structural Discipline** - Emotion + proof balance works

- Collect outputs
- Validate improvements
- Document which criteria now pass

**Step 5: REFACTOR Phase**
- Analyze remaining failures
- Update skill to close loopholes
- Re-test
- Iterate until Cameron approves

**Step 6: Multi-Model Validation**
- Test 2 representative scenarios on Haiku, Sonnet, Opus
- Ensure works across models

**Step 7: Deploy**
- Final skill ready for production use

## Critical Reminders for Post-/compact Session

1. **Baseline was contaminated first time** - Subagents accessed codebase. TRUE baseline used file access restrictions. Use this method for testing.

2. **Cameron's #1 quality check:** Word choice precision (his first instinct)

3. **The Trinity is EQUALLY important** - All 3 must work together (user-outcome + precision + emotion)

4. **Production studio positioning:** 0/6 baseline scenarios got this right. CRITICAL skill component.

5. **"Transform" appears 5 TIMES** - Must be in banned words with explanation why

6. **Scenario 6 proves baseline CAN succeed** - When structure is clear (emotion + proof), baseline does well. Skill just needs to teach the structure.

7. **Briefing Engine live copy is the quality bar** - Use it as proven example throughout

8. **Cameron wants to review subjectively** - Objective criteria guide, but he validates final quality

9. **Budget positioning violation:** "without the agency price tag" is WRONG - we're premium, not cheap

10. **Accuracy violations happened:** "in minutes" for videos, "scale without headcount" on wrong service - Guardrails are critical

## Cameron's Approval Checkpoints

**Before claiming skill is ready:**
1. All TIER 1 failures addressed?
2. <500 lines in SKILL.md?
3. KB total ~20-25k tokens (not bloated)?
4. Test improvements vs baseline documented?
5. **Cameron says:** "Yes, this is the quality I want"

**Cameron will validate:**
- Premium feel
- Cre8tive voice match
- Emotional resonance
- Positioning appropriateness
