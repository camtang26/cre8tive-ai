# Briefing Engine Copy Implementation Plan

**Version:** 2.0 (Critically Rethought)
**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Status:** Ready for Review

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines every copy change for the Briefing Engine page. Each change has been critically evaluated to ensure it:

1. **Serves the section's purpose** (not just repeating features)
2. **Communicates holistically** (the full product value, not one detail)
3. **Uses customer language** (not AI buzzwords)
4. **Sets accurate expectations** (storyboard speed vs video production timeline)

### Core Strategic Positioning:

**Briefing Engine = Fast, intelligent storyboard creation**
**Our Studio = Quality video production**
**Together = Complete solution from concept to delivery**

---

## Critical Thinking Framework

Before writing each line, I asked:

1. **What is this section trying to communicate?**
2. **What does the customer need to know HERE specifically?**
3. **Am I being specific and honest, or am I using generic AI buzzwords?**
4. **Does this line serve the customer, or am I just repeating features?**

---

## Section 1: Hero Section

### Purpose:
Hook visitors with the core value proposition: Fast storyboard creation that connects to video production.

### Current Copy:

```
H1: AI Briefing Engine
H2: From Brand Brief to Professional Storyboard in Minutes
Body: AI-powered briefing platform that transforms your brand vision into production-ready storyboards. Choose from 9 visual styles, delivered as professional PDFs.
```

### Problems:
- H1 is product name, not benefit
- "AI-powered" is generic buzzword
- Doesn't mention Studio connection
- No proof/comparison

### NEW COPY (Critically Thought Through):

```tsx
<h1>Campaign Brief to Storyboard in 10 Minutes</h1>

<h2>What takes agencies 2-5 days, we do in 10 minutes.
Production-ready storyboards. Then our Studio produces the video.</h2>

<p>AI optimized for video production workflows—not generic ChatGPT prompts.
Intelligent forms guide you through seven inputs. AI generates script, storyboard,
and scene breakdown with platform specs. Export to PDF or hand off to our Studio.</p>

<div className="stats-bar">
  <span>2-5 days → 10 minutes</span>
  <span>60% first-draft approval</span>
  <span>4.8/5 stars</span>
  <span>200+ projects</span>
</div>
```

### Why This Works:

**H1:** Outcome + timeline (specific, measurable)
**H2:** Industry comparison FIRST (creates contrast), then Studio connection
**Body:**
- Line 1: Differentiates from ChatGPT (without over-explaining)
- Line 2: Shows the process (intelligent forms → inputs)
- Line 3: Lists actual deliverables (script, storyboard, specs)
- Line 4: Clear options (PDF or Studio)

**Stats bar:** Proof without hype

### What I Didn't Do:
- ❌ Mention cinematography 3 times
- ❌ Use "transforms your vision" (vague)
- ❌ Say "AI-powered" without explaining why it's different
- ❌ Focus on one technical detail

---

## Section 2: Meta Tags

### NEW:

```tsx
<title>Briefing Engine | Storyboard to Video in 10 Minutes | Cre8tive AI</title>

<meta name="description" content="Production-ready storyboards in 10 minutes vs 2-5 days
for traditional agencies. AI optimized for video production. Then our Studio produces
the video. 60% first-draft approval rate." />
```

### Why:
- "Storyboard to Video" (full value chain)
- Industry comparison (2-5 days)
- Studio connection
- Social proof (60% approval)

---

## Section 3: Timeline Section Intro (NEW)

### Purpose:
Set context before users see the 5-step timeline. Clarify storyboard (10 min) vs video (days-weeks).

### NEW Section (Add before `<BriefingTimeline />`):

```tsx
<section className="relative py-16 px-4">
  <div className="container mx-auto max-w-4xl text-center">
    <p className="text-xs font-semibold uppercase tracking-[0.5em] text-white/60 mb-4">
      The Process
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-black tracking-tight text-white mb-6">
      From Brief to Video in 5 Steps
    </h2>

    <p className="text-xl text-white/70 max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-8">
      Traditional agencies take 2-5 days to create briefs and storyboards.
      Our AI completes production-ready storyboards in 10 minutes.
      Then our Studio handles video production (timeline depends on complexity).
    </p>

    <div className="inline-flex items-center gap-6 text-white/60 text-sm">
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
        <span className="text-2xl font-bold text-cyan-400">10 min</span>
        <span>Storyboard</span>
      </div>
      <span className="text-white/30">→</span>
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
        <span className="text-2xl font-bold text-fuchsia-400">Weeks</span>
        <span>Video Production</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

### Why This Works:
- Visual separation of timelines (10 min vs weeks)
- Honest about Studio timeline ("depends on complexity")
- Industry comparison reinforces speed advantage
- Simple, clear language

---

## Section 4: Timeline Step Descriptions

### File: `src/components/briefing/sections/section-data.ts`

### Critical Thinking Per Step:

**Step 01: What does the customer DO here?**
→ They fill out intelligent forms. Emphasize ease and guidance.

**Step 02: What does the AI DO here?**
→ Generates script, synopsis, storyboard. Emphasize output, not how.

**Step 03: What does the customer CHOOSE here?**
→ Visual style. Keep it simple (stakeholder: remove "nine").

**Step 04: What is DELIVERED here?**
→ Complete storyboard with specs. Add "multiple durations" (stakeholder request).

**Step 05: What happens NEXT?**
→ Handoff to Studio. Be HONEST about timeline.

### NEW Step Descriptions:

```typescript
export const stageMetadata = [
  {
    id: "stage-hero",
    step: "Step 01",
    title: "Enter Your Brief",
    description: "Seven intelligent form fields guide you—no AI expertise required. Campaign goal, audience, tone, platform specs, and visual direction.",
    accent: briefingPalette.indigo.DEFAULT
  },
  {
    id: "stage-synthesis",
    step: "Step 02",
    title: "AI Generates the Story",
    description: "AI generates script, synopsis, and scene-by-scene breakdown in under 60 seconds. Optimized for video production workflows.",
    accent: briefingPalette.holographic.cyan
  },
  {
    id: "stage-styles",
    step: "Step 03",
    title: "Choose Your Visual Style",
    description: "Signature visual styles snap into place—fully customizable to your brand.",
    accent: briefingPalette.fuchsia.DEFAULT
  },
  {
    id: "stage-storyboard",
    step: "Step 04",
    title: "Storyboard Assembly",
    description: "Complete storyboard with scene markers, multiple durations (15s/30s/60s), platform specs (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram), and director notes—ready for our Studio.",
    accent: briefingPalette.cyan.DEFAULT
  },
  {
    id: "stage-handoff",
    step: "Step 05",
    title: "Studios Handoff",
    description: "Export as PDF or hand off to Cre8tive AI Studios for video production. Production timeline depends on complexity—typically days to weeks.",
    accent: briefingPalette.orange.DEFAULT
  }
];
```

### Why Each Change:

**Step 01:**
- "Intelligent form fields guide you" (ease of use)
- "No AI expertise required" (objection handling)
- Lists what they input (transparency)

**Step 02:**
- "AI generates..." (clear output)
- Removed "neural choreography" (pretentious)
- "Optimized for video production" (differentiates, but not obsessed with one detail)

**Step 03:**
- Removed "Nine" (stakeholder feedback)
- "Fully customizable" (addresses brand concern)

**Step 04:**
- **ADDED: "multiple durations" and "platform specs"** (stakeholder request, important feature)
- Specific examples in parentheses (concrete)
- "Ready for our Studio" (connection)

**Step 05:**
- **CRITICAL: Added realistic timeline** ("days to weeks")
- "Depends on complexity" (honest, manages expectations)
- Two options: PDF or Studio (flexibility)

### Why:
- "Storyboard to Video" (full value chain, stakeholder feedback)
- Separated timelines clearly
- "Our Studio" (ownership clarity)
- CTA matches hero ("Start Your Brief")

---

## Section 6: AudienceBenefits

### Current Header:

```tsx
<h2>Tailored Storyboards for Agencies & Brands</h2>
```

### NEW Header:

```tsx
<h2>For Agencies & Brands Who Need Speed Without Compromise</h2>
```

### Why:
- Benefit-driven (speed + quality)
- Not just "tailored storyboards" (what does that mean?)
- Addresses core desire from Gemini research

### Current Description:

```tsx
<p>Every stakeholder gets a dedicated storyboard lane...</p>
```

### NEW Description:

```tsx
<p>Agencies scale multi-client workflows. Brands launch campaigns faster.

---

### Agency Benefits Updates:

**"Increase Team Productivity" - ADD multiple durations:**

```tsx
{
  badge: "AGENCIES 03",
  title: "Deliver Multi-Platform Specs",
  description: "Every storyboard includes multiple durations (15s, 30s, 60s) and platform specs (YouTube 16:9, TikTok 9:16, Instagram 1:1)—no manual reformatting.",
  ...
}
```

**Why:**

## Section 7: FAQ Section (NEW - CRITICAL)

### Purpose:
Handle objections and confusion BEFORE they bounce.

### 10 Questions (Critically Thought Through):

**1. How is your AI different from ChatGPT?**

Answer: "Our AI is fine-tuned for video production workflows—script writing, storyboarding, scene composition, and platform optimization. Generic AI tools like ChatGPT require expert prompting. Our intelligent forms guide you to provide exactly what's needed. Result: 60% first-draft approval vs. 20-30% industry average."

**Why:** Differentiates without obsessing over one detail (mentions multiple aspects of video production)

---

**2. How long does it take to get a video?**

Answer: "Storyboard creation: 10 minutes. Video production through our Studio: typically days to weeks, depending on complexity and scope. We prioritize quality. The storyboard gives you a production-ready plan immediately; our Studio then delivers professional-grade video."

**Why:** CRITICAL question. Sets realistic expectations. Separates timelines clearly.

---

**3. Do I need AI expertise to use this?**

Answer: "No. Our intelligent forms are designed to guide you through seven straightforward questions about your campaign. The AI handles the complex translation into production-ready storyboards—no prompt engineering required."

**Why:** Reduces friction. "Intelligent forms" positioning.

---

**4. What makes your storyboards 'production-ready'?**

Answer: "Every storyboard includes: scene-by-scene breakdown, script and synopsis, director notes for cinematography and pacing, platform specifications (YouTube 16:9, TikTok 9:16, Instagram 1:1), multiple durations (15s, 30s, 60s), and visual style references. You can export as PDF or hand off directly to our Studio."

**Why:** Lists tangible deliverables. Justifies "production-ready" claim.

---

**5. Can I use the storyboard without hiring your Studio?**

Answer: "Yes. Export as a professional PDF and take it to any production team. Many clients use Briefing Engine as a standalone planning tool. The Studios handoff is optional—we built this to be valuable whether you produce with us or elsewhere."

**Why:** Removes lock-in fear. Shows confidence in standalone value.

---

**6. How accurate is the '2-5 days' traditional timeline claim?**

Answer: "Industry research from Smartsheet, QuickFrame, and Boords (2024-2025) shows traditional agency briefing and storyboarding takes 2-5 days depending on complexity. This includes client meetings, revisions, and internal approvals. Our AI completes the same output in 10 minutes."

**Why:** Backs up the claim with sources. Shows we did research.

---

**7. What visual styles are available?**

Answer: "Nine signature styles: Minimalist, Bold & Vibrant, Cinematic, Playful & Animated, Futuristic, Retro & Vintage, Documentary, Artistic Abstract, and 2D Vector. Each style is fully customizable to your brand's colors, typography, and tone."

**Why:** Product education. Addresses customization concern.

---

**8. Can agencies handle multiple clients on the platform?**

Answer: "Yes. Agencies regularly manage 50+ concurrent briefs. Each maintains its own brand guidelines, visual style, and campaign parameters. The platform is built for high-volume workflows."

**Why:** Scalability proof. Specific number (50+).

---

**9. How does the AI understand different industries?**

Answer: "Our intelligent forms capture industry context, brand personality, and unique selling points. The AI—trained on diverse video production projects—uses these inputs to generate tailored storyboards. If the first output needs refinement, iterate in real-time."

**Why:** Addresses quality concern. Shows flexibility.

---

**10. Is there a free trial?**

Answer: "Yes. Start your first brief with no credit card required. Complete the briefing process, see the AI-generated storyboard, and export to PDF. If you want video production, talk to our Studio team about pricing and timelines."

**Why:** Removes risk. Clear next steps.

### FAQ Component Code:

See separate component file at: `src/components/briefing/BriefingFAQ.tsx`

(Same implementation as before, but answers updated with critically thought-through copy above)

## Section 8: Final CTA

### Current:

```tsx
<h2>Start Creating Premium Storyboards—Free Trial</h2>
<p>Your Brand, Your Vision, Our AI—Perfect Storyboards, Every Time</p>
```

### NEW:

```tsx
<h2>From Brief to Video—Start Your First Storyboard</h2>
<p>10 minutes to storyboard. Professional video from our Studio.
One platform from concept to delivery.</p>
```

### Why:
- "From Brief to Video" (full journey)
- Timeline separation (10 min storyboard, then Studio)
- "Our Studio" (ownership)
- "One platform" (convenience)

---

## Section 9: BriefingProcessFlow - "Briefing Runway" Description

### File Location:
`src/components/briefing/BriefingProcessFlow.tsx` (lines 289-294)

### Current:

```tsx
<h2>The Briefing Runway</h2>
<p>Navigate the stack—each card reveals a briefing milestone while future
steps hover in view. Open the dossier to explore deliverables and metrics
for the active stage.</p>
```

### NEW:

```tsx
<h2>The Briefing Runway</h2>
<p>Navigate the stack—each card reveals a briefing milestone while future
steps hover in view.</p>
```

### Changes:
**DELETE** the second sentence: "Open the dossier to explore deliverables and metrics for the active stage."

### Why:
Stakeholder feedback: "DELETE this next sentence does not make sense"

The sentence is confusing—"dossier" isn't clear UI language, and users don't need to be told how to interact with the cards.

---

## Section 10: Remove VisualStylesGallery

### Action:
DELETE this section from `BriefingEngine.tsx`:

```tsx
// DELETE:
<GsapFadeIn>
  <VisualStylesGallery />
</GsapFadeIn>
```

### Why:
Stakeholder feedback: "we will be removing the 'choose your creative style' section"

It's redundant with Step 03 in the timeline.
