     ## Key Messaging Principles

     ### ✅ ALWAYS Do:

     1. **Lead with quality + multi-platform capability** (your differentiator)
     2. **Use validated industry statistics** with proper citations
     3. **Show portfolio prominently** (proof over promises)
     4. **Emphasize hybrid AI + human workflow** (industry standard)
     5. **Highlight specific production components** without naming tools
     6. **Connect Briefing Engine → Studios workflow** clearly
     7. **Position as professional tool, not toy**
     8. **Mention image-to-video as quality approach**
     9. **List all 6 platforms** (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, X, Facebook)

     ### ❌ NEVER Do:

     1. **Don't use unvalidated metrics** (95% satisfaction, specific dollar savings without proof)
     2. **Don't name specific tools** (Runway, Topaz, ElevenLabs, Suno, etc.)
     3. **Don't lead with speed** (it's a secondary benefit)
     4. **Don't use defensive messaging** ("AI won't replace you")
     5. **Don't hide portfolio** (it's your best asset)
     6. **Don't oversimplify production process** (show full-stack value)
     7. **Don't show fake storyboard-to-production examples**
