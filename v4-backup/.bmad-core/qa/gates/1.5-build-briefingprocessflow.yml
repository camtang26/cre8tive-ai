nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns. Static content only, no user input, no external calls. SVG content is static with no injection risk.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent performance. GPU-accelerated transforms only (opacity, translateY, scale). Single ScrollTrigger instance with proper cleanup. 60fps target achievable.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Robust error prevention with GSAP cleanup (gsap.context + ctx.revert). Graceful degradation for prefers-reduced-motion. TypeScript prevents type errors.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent maintainability. Clear component separation, self-documenting code, architecture patterns followed exactly. Reference implementation quality.'

code_quality:
  architecture_compliance: EXCELLENT
  type_safety: EXCELLENT
  accessibility: EXCELLENT
  performance: EXCELLENT
  notes: |
    - Perfect implementation of Pattern 1 from animation-patterns.md
    - Proper GSAP cleanup with gsap.context() prevents memory leaks
    - Full prefers-reduced-motion support via custom hook
    - Strong TypeScript types with proper interfaces
    - Uses briefingPalette for color consistency
    - GPU-accelerated animations only
    - Semantic HTML with ARIA attributes

best_practices_highlighted:
  - 'Exemplary GSAP cleanup pattern - should be referenced in future stories'
  - 'Proper accessibility implementation with usePrefersReducedMotion hook'
  - 'Strong TypeScript typing with clear interfaces'
  - 'Consistent palette usage - zero hard-coded colors'
  - 'Architecture pattern adherence - matches docs exactly'

team_notes: |
  This implementation represents a gold standard for GSAP integration in this
  project. The developer followed architecture patterns meticulously, implemented
  proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks, and included full accessibility support.

  Recommend using this code as a reference example for:
  - GSAP ScrollTrigger Pattern 1 implementation
  - React useEffect cleanup patterns
  - prefers-reduced-motion accessibility
  - TypeScript component typing
  - briefingPalette integration

  No issues found during review. Code is production-ready and exceeds quality
  expectations. Story can proceed directly to "Done" status.
