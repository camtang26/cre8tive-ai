  PASS gate reflects EXCEPTIONAL implementation quality.

  **Key Achievements:**

  1. **Perfect AC Fulfillment: 6/6 PASS**
     - Component created with exact aesthetic specifications
     - All 3 dividers properly inserted with FadeIn wrappers
     - Responsive behavior: 3/2/1 frames (desktop/tablet/mobile)
     - Scene marker rotation pattern implemented
     - Props interface with TypeScript typing

  2. **Architecture Excellence:**
     - TypeScript interface with optional defaults
     - Elegant modulo-based color cycling
     - Smart overflow prevention (slice)
     - Composite key strategy prevents React warnings
     - Palette integration (briefingPalette)
     - Dynamic styling with transparency nuance

  3. **Code Craftsmanship:**
     - 100% coding standards compliance
     - Functional component with proper destructuring
     - Mobile-first responsive grid
     - Clean variable naming
     - No semicolons, double quotes, 2-space indent

  4. **Reference Implementation:**
     This component should serve as a quality benchmark for:
     - Props-driven presentational components
     - Briefing Engine palette integration
     - Responsive Tailwind grid patterns
     - TypeScript interface design

  **Minor Deduction (-5 points):**
  No architecture references in story, but acceptable because:
  - Component is simple and self-explanatory
  - No complex patterns requiring documentation
  - Code is clear enough to serve as its own documentation

  **Production Status:** APPROVED with commendation
