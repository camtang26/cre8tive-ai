nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No user input, static content, no security concerns"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "GPU-accelerated transforms (translate, scale, opacity, filter), lazy loading images, ScrollTrigger cleanup via gsap.context(), 240px/s scroll rate optimized for smooth 60fps performance"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "prefers-reduced-motion fallback shows final state, null checks on all refs, Lenis integration via useLenis hook, ScrollTrigger cleanup prevents memory leaks"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive JSDoc (46 lines), named constants (SCROLL_PIXELS_PER_SECOND, DESKTOP_BREAKPOINT, STAGE_COUNT), inline comments for complex logic, follows frontend-architecture.md component template"
  accessibility:
    status: PASS
    notes: "prefers-reduced-motion detection with static final state fallback, ARIA labels (aria-label on section), semantic HTML (section, aside tags), keyboard-friendly (scroll-driven, no interactive elements)"

integration_verifications:
  iv1_lenis_compatibility:
    status: PASS
    notes: "useLenis hook integration (line 72) syncs ScrollTrigger updates with Lenis smooth scroll"
  iv2_resize_sync:
    status: PASS
    notes: "anticipatePin: 1 prevents flicker, matchMedia for responsive desktop detection"
  iv3_reverse_scroll:
    status: PASS
    notes: "scrub: true enables bidirectional timeline control (scroll back reverses animation)"

architecture_compliance:
  pattern_used: "Pattern 2: Scrub Animation (Scroll = Playhead)"
  reference: "docs/architecture/animation-patterns.md lines 148-206"
  notes: "Correctly implements gsap.context() cleanup pattern (not useGSAP), follows established project standard"
