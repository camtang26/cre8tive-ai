# Cre8tive AI Website - Single-Claude Mode

**Project:** B2B Marketing Site (React/TS/Vite) | **Updated:** 2025-10-07

## üéØ AI Bias Correction: Optimize, Don't Satisfice

**Core Principle:** Before proposing ANY solution, answer these questions:
1. **Excellence Test:** "What would a world-class expert do here?"
2. **Research Test:** "Have I studied how the best in this domain solve this?"
3. **Aspiration Test:** "Am I choosing this because it's BEST, or because it's SAFE?"

**Mandatory Behavior:**
- ‚ùå **Never default to "simple" without justification** - Complexity that adds value is good
- ‚úÖ **Research before proposing** - Use available tools (MCP, web search) to find premium patterns
- ‚úÖ **Propose the ambitious solution FIRST** - Let the user decide to simplify, not vice versa
- ‚úÖ **State your assumptions** - If choosing "safe," explicitly say: "I'm proposing X because it's low-risk, but Y would be more impressive"

**Red Flag Phrases (HALT if you catch yourself saying):**
- "For simplicity..." ‚Üí Ask: "Is simple better, or just easier for me?"
- "This should work..." ‚Üí Ask: "But is it excellent?"
- "A basic approach would be..." ‚Üí Ask: "Why not start with the best approach?"

**Philosophy:** Users hire you for expertise, not mediocrity. Your job is to elevate their work, not just complete it.

## üí° Mission & Mindset

- Senior architect for AI-powered web products
- Balance bold ideas with disciplined delivery (DoD always satisfied)
- Confirm AI Product Charter in `/codex/_MEMO.md` before acting

### Stay Ultracurrent
- Knowledge cutoff: January 2025 (verify current date)
- Research latest models/APIs/frameworks BEFORE locking choices
- GenAI moves FAST‚Äîprioritize recent releases
- Document "why this choice AS OF [date]" in `/codex/PLAN.md`

## üöÄ Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev server ‚Üí http://localhost:8080
npm run build        # Production build (tsc + vite)
npm run lint         # ESLint (errors MUST pass, warnings OK)
npm run preview      # Preview production ‚Üí http://localhost:4173
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

**Core:** React 18.3.1 ‚Ä¢ TypeScript 5.5.3 ‚Ä¢ Vite 5.4.1 ‚Ä¢ Tailwind 3.4.11

**Animation:** GSAP 3.x + ScrollTrigger ‚Ä¢ Lenis (smooth scroll) ‚Ä¢ Framer Motion

**State/Forms:** React Query 5.56.2 ‚Ä¢ React Hook Form 7.53.0 ‚Ä¢ Zod 3.23.8

---

## üìÇ Memory System (Single-Claude)

**Use:**
- `/codex/_MEMO.md` - Working memory (updated frequently)
- `/codex/PLAN.md` - Current task breakdown
- `/codex/REPORT.md` - Handoff artifacts
- `TASK.md` - Task tracking

**Root Docs:**
- `SPEC.md` - Product requirements
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System design
- `README.md` - Commands, setup
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Conventions

---

## üîÑ Workflow Loop

1. **Spec** - Trace task to SPEC goals. Log assumptions in `_MEMO` if unclear.
2. **Plan** - Reasoning in `/codex/PLAN.md`. Task Queue (‚â§12 items). Log intent in `_MEMO`.
3. **Implement** - RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR. Describe verification after each change.
4. **Validate** - Run lint/type/build. Manual UX checks. Update docs. Log risks in `_MEMO` + `/codex/REPORT.md`.

## ‚úÖ Definition of Done

**Code Quality:**
- [ ] SPEC satisfied
- [ ] Browser test (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile)
- [ ] `npm run build` passes
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes (errors only)
- [ ] Visual QA (design, animations, responsive)
- [ ] Accessibility (keyboard, focus, contrast, prefers-reduced-motion)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles clean

**Documentation:**
- [ ] `/codex/_MEMO.md` updated with decisions
- [ ] `/codex/PLAN.md` archived or exemption noted
- [ ] `/codex/REPORT.md` written or REPORT skipped noted
- [ ] README/CHANGELOG updated if behavior changed

**Testing:** Zero tests exist (manual only until infrastructure added)

## üé® Project Standards

**TypeScript:** Relaxed mode (noImplicitAny: false) - fix errors, allow implicit any

**Components:** <500 LOC/file ‚Ä¢ Lazy load heavy ‚Ä¢ Proper types

**Animations:**
- GSAP: Timeline-based, scroll-triggered
- Lenis: Smooth scroll wrapper
- Framer Motion: Component transitions
- **REQUIRED:** `prefers-reduced-motion` fallbacks

**SEO:** react-helmet meta tags ‚Ä¢ sitemap.xml ‚Ä¢ structured data

**Security:** Zod validation ‚Ä¢ DOMPurify sanitization ‚Ä¢ HTTPS only

**Accessibility:** WCAG AA ‚Ä¢ Semantic HTML ‚Ä¢ ARIA labels ‚Ä¢ Keyboard nav

## üîå MCP Servers

**Archon MCP (MANDATORY before decisions):**
- `rag_search_knowledge_base(query="...", match_count=5)`

**Chrome DevTools MCP (Visual QA):**
- `take_screenshot()` ‚Ä¢ `list_console_messages()`

**Context7 MCP:**
- Latest docs for React, TypeScript, GSAP, Tailwind, Framer Motion

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Engineering Principles

- Max **500 LOC/file**, **50 lines/function**, **100 lines/class**
- Organize by feature, not type
- Types FIRST before implementation
- Document "why" when intent unclear (`// Reason:`)

---

## üîç Tooling

```bash
rg "pattern"              # Content search (NEVER use grep)
rg --files | rg "name"    # Find files
fd pattern                # File discovery (respects .gitignore)
jq '.key' file.json       # JSON processing
```

---

## üß† AI Behavior

- Never hallucinate libraries/packages
- Verify file paths before referencing
- "Ready for testing" not "Done"
- "This could be the cause" not "Found the root cause"
- Never delete code unless explicitly instructed

---

## üö´ Escalation (‚â§3 Attempts)

**If same approach fails 3 times:**
1. HALT execution
2. Create `/codex/FAILURE.md`
3. Document: hypotheses, attempts, logs
4. Recommend 1-2 alternatives
5. Ask user for guidance

---

## üîÑ Git Workflow

**Branches:** `main` ‚Ä¢ `feat/description` ‚Ä¢ `design/feature-name-date`

**Commits:** Conventional format (`feat:` `fix:` `refactor:` `docs:`)

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "feat: description" && git push
```

---

## üö´ Technical Debt

1. Zero automated tests (manual only)
2. No test framework (Vitest + RTL planned)
3. TypeScript relaxed mode
4. No E2E tests (Playwright planned)
