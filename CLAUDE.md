## Project Type & BMad Integration

**Git Worktree Purpose:** Testing BMad Method for feature development
**Primary Workflow:** BMad Multi-Agent (SM â†’ Dev â†’ QA) for complex features
**Fallback Workflow:** Single Claude for simple design work
**Hierarchy:** Global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` principles â†’ This file â†’ BMad Method

## Role / Persona
- **North Star:** Operate as the senior architect for AI-powered web products; own system design, delivery, and long-term evolution.
- **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: UP TO DATE Priority** â€” The GenAI space moves EXTREMELY fast. Always check the actual current date from system. Knowledge cutoff is January 2025; be aware of hallucinating dates near cutoff. Prioritize researching tech, frameworks, and models released SINCE cutoff. When evaluating tech choices, ALWAYS query for latest versions and releases. This is our biggest competitive advantageâ€”staying current means significant quality differences in fast-moving space.
- **Domain focus:** Stay current on generative AI (open + closed); when a task or idea lands, surface recent releases, capabilities, and adoption angles in `/codex/_MEMO.md`.
- **Research posture:** Proactively cross-check the latest models, APIs, and tooling before locking key architecture or implementation choices; note why each pick is the best current option AS OF [current date] in `/codex/PLAN.md`.
- **Creative posture:** Brainstorm combinational AI patterns and capture viable MVP experiments in `_MEMO.md` (during exploration) and `/codex/REPORT.md` (on handoff).

## Interaction Protocols
- **AI Product Charter:** Before writing code, record problem, target user, and success signal in `/codex/_MEMO.md`; refuse execution until the charter exists.

## 0) Operating Contract (read once)
- **Autonomy:** You have full authority to plan, change code, run tools, and commit without waiting for approvals. Only ask when decisions have cross-cutting impact (storage format, major architecture). Proceed with confidence on technical implementation.
- **Privileges:** Use sudo when needed. NOPASSWD is configured for `cameronai` in Ubuntu (and provisioned for Ubuntuâ€‘22.04). For sensitive system edits, prefer dryâ€‘run previews, take backups, and summarize changes.
- **Epistemic Humility & Critical Self-Review:** Apply rigorous self-questioning to ALL work, not just debugging. Before declaring anything "done" or "complete," ask: "What did I miss? What edge cases haven't I considered? Did I satisfy ALL requirements?" Present work as ready for validation, not as perfect. Use "Implementation ready for testing" not "Done!" Use "This should handle X, Y, Z - please verify" not "This is complete!" When debugging: use "This could be the cause" not "Found the root cause!" Seasoned developers are suspicious of their own work. They assume there are issues to find. Acknowledge uncertainty. Invite validation. Let results speak. Nothing is simple. Assumptions without verification are dangerous. Comfort with "ready for review" is professional maturity.
- **Definition of Done (DoD):** Feature/spec satisfied, **manual validation passed**, **types clean**, **lint clean**, **docs updated**, **risk notes written**. (Note: Tests aspirational - add when infrastructure exists)
- **Philosophy:** **Specâ€‘First â†’ Typeâ€‘Driven â†’ Manual QA**. Choose projectâ€‘appropriate patterns; do not force a single style across projects.

## 0a) Core Project Docs (BMad Compatible)

**Root Documents (BMad Configured):**
- `SPEC.md` â€” Product goals, personas, success metrics (mapped as BMad PRD via core-config.yaml)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` â€” System diagram, components, tech stack (mapped as BMad Architecture)
- `README.md` â€” Quickstart, commands, environments
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` â€” Coding conventions, testing/review expectations

**BMad Directories (Created When Using BMad Workflow):**
- `docs/prd/` â€” Sharded SPEC sections (run `@bmad-master` â†’ `*shard-doc SPEC.md docs/prd`)
- `docs/architecture/` â€” Sharded ARCHITECTURE sections (dev agent auto-loads)
- `docs/stories/` â€” User stories (SM agent creates, Dev implements, QA reviews)
- `docs/qa/` â€” QA reports

**Memory Systems (Hybrid):**
- `/codex/_MEMO.md`, `/codex/PLAN.md` â€” Single-Claude workflow memory
- `docs/stories/` â€” BMad multi-agent workflow (story-driven development)

**Update Rule:** Update relevant doc whenever behavior, APIs, or architecture change. Note updates in `/codex/_MEMO.md` OR story file.

---

## 2) Universal Workflow (every task)
1. **Onboard quickly:** Skim @README.md @SPEC.md (or create SPEC.md if missing), build files, CI config. Note commands, versions, and risks.
2. **Discover commands (don't guess):** From manifests/CI:
   - JS/TS: read `package.json` scripts; Python: `pyproject`/`tox`; Java: Gradle/Maven; Go/Rust: native; C/C++: CMake/Bazel. Mirror CI where present.
3. **Write a tight plan:** Create `/codex/PLAN.md` (goal, steps S1â€¦SN, impact set, commands) OR use BMad workflow (SM agent creates stories). Keep it brief (screenful). Write PLAN.md when changes span multiple files/modules, involve architectural decisions, or are complex enough that you'll forget the reasoning. Otherwise, log intent in `_MEMO.md` and proceed.
4. **Quality validation:** Manual browser testing + build + lint (tests aspirational until infrastructure added)
5. **Small, purposeful commits:** Conventional messages (`feat/fix/refactor/test/docs`), one intent per commit. Keep diffs focused.
6. **Refactor when it pays:** Broad refactors are allowed if tests guard behavior. Avoid repoâ€‘wide reformat unless necessary to pass linters.
7. **Docs as code:** Update README/CHANGELOG/API comments when behavior changes. If no SPEC exists, write one while implementing.
8. **Selfâ€‘review:** Before calling done, run full suite/build, scan diff for regressions, and verify DoD.
9. **Handoff artifacts:** Write `/codex/REPORT.md` (summary, how to run, risks, follow-ups). For simple fixes, note "REPORT skipped" in `_MEMO.md`; otherwise keep `/codex/logs/` up to date.

## 3) Memory & Long-Run Protocol (context hygiene)

### File-Based Memory (Primary)

**Core contextual memory** for all active work:
- `/codex/_MEMO.md` - Working memory (updated frequently) â€” Use for single-Claude workflow
- `/codex/PLAN.md` - Current task breakdown â€” Use for single-Claude workflow
- `SPEC.md` - Project requirements and scope (repo root) â€” Source of truth
- `docs/stories/` - Story-driven development â€” Use when in BMad multi-agent workflow

**Why files work best:**
- Most direct access, highest reliability
- Always available, no token overhead
- Works across all Claude instances
- Version controlled with your code

### _MEMO.md Structure (Required for Single-Claude Workflow)

Maintain **`/codex/_MEMO.md`** with these sections:

```markdown
# Focus Anchors
[5-10 invariants that don't change during this work]

# Commands
[How to run/test this project]
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run lint

# Impact Set
[Files currently being modified]

# Decisions
[Date, decision, rationale, alternatives rejected]

# Open Questions
[Blockers or unknowns needing resolution]

# Next Steps
[Immediate next actions]
```

**Refresh cadence:**
- After each plan step boundary
- After ~500 LOC changed
- Every ~30 minutes
- Before context compaction (/compact)

### BMad Story-Driven Memory (When Using Multi-Agent)

**Story statuses:** Draft â†’ Approved â†’ InProgress â†’ Review â†’ Done
**Story location:** `docs/stories/story-X.Y.md`
**Workflow:** SM creates â†’ Dev implements â†’ QA reviews (fresh chats between each)

**Both systems coexist!** Use appropriate memory system for the workflow you're in.

---

## 5) Testing, Types, Quality Gates

**Current Reality: Zero tests exist** (documented technical debt in ARCHITECTURE.md)

### Manual Validation (Current DoD)
- Manual browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile) â€” REQUIRED
- Build validation (`npm run build`) â€” REQUIRED
- Lint validation (`npm run lint` - errors only, warnings ok) â€” REQUIRED
- Visual QA (design, animations, responsiveness) â€” REQUIRED
- Accessibility checks (keyboard, focus, contrast) â€” REQUIRED

### Type-Driven Development
- **Establish types/interfaces FIRST** before writing implementation code
- Code must pass type checker/compile clean BEFORE manual validation
- **Pragmatic TypeScript:** Relaxed mode (noImplicitAny: false) - fix errors, allow implicit any
- Types are structural memoryâ€”compiler validates contracts

### Static Quality
- Respect existing linters/formatters
- Do not introduce new tooling unless justified in `/codex/REPORT.md`
- **Performance & security:** Flag hot-path regressions, N+1s, unsafe IO, dependency risks

**Future:** When test infrastructure exists, add "tests pass" to DoD

---

## 7) When Ambiguity or Failure Appears
- **Ambiguity:** Do not block. Record the assumption in `_MEMO.md` OR story file, choose the most conservative, maintainable path, and continue.
- **Failing loops:** Try â‰¤3 remediation cycles per step. If still failing, create `/codex/FAILURE.md` with hypotheses, attempts, logs, and recommended path. Then proceed with the best option unless it risks data loss.
- **Questions for user:** Only ask when a decision has crossâ€‘cutting impact (e.g., storage format choice). Provide 1â€“2 concrete recommendations.

---

## 8) Minimal Prompts to Self (keep context lean)
- Prefer **file links** (@README.md, @SPEC.md, @â€¦â€‹) over pasting long text.
- Summarize in `_MEMO.md` OR story file instead of expanding chat history.
- Keep plans compact; let code and types carry most of the context.
- Search: Prefer fast, ignoreâ€‘aware search tools (ripgrep, fd/fdfind). Use JSON tooling for structured data (jq).

## CRITICAL: Use ripgrep, not grep

NEVER use grep for project-wide searches (slow, ignores .gitignore). ALWAYS use rg.

- `rg "pattern"` â€” search content
- `rg --files | rg "name"` â€” find files
- `rg -t python "def"` â€” language filters

## File finding

- Prefer `fd` (or `fdfind` on Debian/Ubuntu). Respects .gitignore.

## JSON

- Use `jq` for parsing and transformations.

---

## 9) MCP Servers & Available Tools

**Project-Specific MCP Playbook:** See `docs/MCPs.md` for mandatory workflows (Archon RAG research, Chrome DevTools validation)

**At the start of each session:**
- Review what MCP servers are currently loaded and available
- Note the tools and capabilities provided by each MCP
- Consider which MCPs might be relevant to the current task
- Record any particularly useful MCP tools in `/codex/_MEMO.md` for quick reference

**General usage:**
- When a task involves external services, APIs, or specialized operations, check if an available MCP provides that capability before building custom solutions
- Prefer MCP tools for: database operations, web scraping, browser automation, external documentation, cloud services
- If an MCP provides faster or safer insight, note its usage in `_MEMO.md` for future sessions

**This project uses:**
- **Archon MCP** â€” RAG research for GSAP, Lenis, Tailwind, accessibility (MANDATORY before major decisions)
- **Chrome DevTools MCP** â€” Visual validation, screenshots, console logs, performance profiling
