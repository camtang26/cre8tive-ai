# Cre8tive Copy Excellence

## When to Use This Skill

**Activate this skill when writing, reviewing, or editing copy for Cre8tive AI:**

✅ **Use for:**
- Homepage/landing page copy
- Service-specific pages (Studios, BriefingEngine, Conversational AI)
- Hero sections, CTAs, value props
- Feature descriptions, benefits copy
- FAQs, testimonials, case studies

- Legal/compliance copy
- Copy for other companies/brands

---

## Core Philosophy: The Trinity Framework

**All Cre8tive AI copy must satisfy THREE equally important quality dimensions:**

### 1. User-Outcome Focus
**"YOU achieve" vs "WE provide"**
- Client is the hero, Cre8tive AI is the enabler
- Specific outcomes client gets, not features we provide
- Active voice, strong verbs
- **Deep dive:** reference/user-outcome-framing.md

### 2. Word Choice Precision
**Specific outcomes, not vague benefits**
- "60% first-draft approval" not "better quality"
- "10 minutes" not "fast"
- "Platform-native" not "optimized"
- **Deep dive:** reference/anti-patterns.md (Category 7: Generic Features)

### 3. Emotional Resonance
**Pain/aspiration connection**
- What client avoids: "no agency juggling"
- What client achieves: "platform-perfect campaigns"
- Avoid replacement fear: focus on outcomes only
- **Deep dive:** reference/user-outcome-framing.md (Emotional Resonance section)

**ALL THREE must pass for copy to be approved. If any dimension fails, REWRITE.**

---

## The Workflow: How to Write Cre8tive AI Copy

### Step 1: Identify the Service

**Which service is this copy for?**

- **Studios:** AI-powered Studio partners delivering platform-native video in days
- **BriefingEngine:** AI tool delivering production-ready storyboards in 10 minutes
- **Conversational AI:** AI agents scaling support without headcount
- **Homepage/Multi-Service:** Universal AI mastery + production quality (abstract services, no listing)

**Reference:** reference/service-positioning.md for service-specific positioning

### Step 2: Determine Primary Outcome

**What does the client ACHIEVE with this service?**

**Studios outcomes:**
- Deploy platform-native video (YouTube 16:9, platform-native 9:16, Instagram 1:1, and all major platforms)
- 60% first-draft approval rate
- Scale video production without headcount

**BriefingEngine outcomes:**
1. Studio-ready quality (enables handoff) ← PRIMARY
2. Speed to alignment (10 min vs days)
3. Strategic clarity (cinematography AI)

**Conversational AI outcomes:**
- Scale support without headcount ← PRIMARY
- 24/7 customer experience

**Reference:** reference/service-positioning.md for value hierarchies

### Step 3: Draft Copy (Trinity Framework)

**Apply the Trinity framework:**

**A. User-Outcome Focus:**
- Lead with what CLIENT achieves (YOU/Your)
- Minimize WE/Our language
- Use implied YOU with active verbs ("Lock creative direction")

**B. Word Precision:**
- Specific metrics (60% approval, 10 minutes, platform-native)
- Concrete outcomes, not vague benefits
- No cringe words (revolutionary, cutting-edge, unleash, ignite, automate)

**C. Emotional Resonance:**
- Connect to pain avoided ("no agency juggling")
- Connect to aspiration ("platform-perfect campaigns")
- Avoid replacement fear (focus on outcomes only)

**Pattern:** [YOU outcome] + [specific proof] + [pain/aspiration]

**Example:**
"Deploy platform-native video with 60% first-draft approval—no agency juggling."

### Step 4: Accuracy Check (CRITICAL)

**Run accuracy guardrails:**

**Timeline accuracy:**
- Studios = days for video (NEVER minutes)
- BriefingEngine = 10 min for storyboard (NEVER video)
- Integrated workflow distinguishes storyboard (10 min) from video (days)

**Capability boundaries:**
- Studios delivers final video
- BriefingEngine delivers storyboards (hand off to Studios)
- Conversational AI delivers support scaling

**Metric verification:**
- 60% approval = Studios only
- 10 min = storyboard only
- Platform-native = Studios only
- Since 2023 = all services

**Reference:** reference/accuracy-guardrails.md for full guardrails

### Step 5: Anti-Pattern Detection

**Check for violations:**

**CRITICAL violations (immediate rejection):**
- [ ] Automation/replacement language ("automate video", "no team needed")
- [ ] Self-serve tool positioning ("create videos yourself")
- [ ] Naming specific AI tools (Runway, Pika, Sora)
- [ ] Timeline inaccuracy ("video in minutes" for Studios)
- [ ] Service cross-contamination (BriefingEngine outcomes for Studios)

**HIGH violations (must fix):**
- [ ] Tier 1 cringe words (revolutionary, cutting-edge, unleash, ignite, automate)
- [ ] Technology-first framing ("Our AI does X" vs "YOU achieve Y")
- [ ] Generic features ("better quality" vs "60% approval")

**MEDIUM violations (improve if possible):**
- [ ] Transform overuse (>1x per page)
- [ ] Weak verbs / passive voice
- [ ] Methodology details (except Studios hybrid model)

**Reference:** reference/anti-patterns.md for full detection checklist

### Step 6: Service-Specific Validation

**Studios copy must:**
- [ ] Emphasize hybrid "AI-powered Studio partners" model
- [ ] Lead with platform-native video outcome
- [ ] Timeline accurate (days for video)
- [ ] 60% approval mentioned (if space allows)

**BriefingEngine copy must:**
- [ ] Lead with studio-ready quality (value hierarchy #1)
- [ ] 10-minute storyboard emphasized
- [ ] Hand off to Studios mentioned
- [ ] Timeline accurate (10 min for storyboard, NOT video)

**Conversational AI copy must:**
- [ ] "Scale support without headcount" primary outcome
- [ ] No video/storyboard outcomes (service separation)
- [ ] 24/7 availability mentioned (if space allows)

**Reference:** reference/service-positioning.md for checklists

### Step 7: USP Integration (Masters vs Dabblers)

**Integrate universal positioning:**

**Tent Pole:** Masters vs dabblers in AI technology

**Proof points to use:**
- Since 2023 (early adoption)
- Cinematography-trained AI
- Platform-native specialization
- Hybrid Studio partnership model
- 60% first-draft approval (Studios)

**Tone:** Humble mastery
✅ "We've been mastering AI video production since 2023"
❌ "We're the world's #1 AI video studio"

**Competitive framing:**
- vs AI tools: "Cinematographer vs camera company" metaphor
- vs Agencies: "We've mastered AI, they're learning it"
- vs In-house: Partnership/augmentation, never replacement

**Reference:** reference/cre8tive-usps.md for proof points and positioning

### Step 8: Final Trinity Check

**Before approving, verify ALL THREE dimensions pass:**

**User-Outcome Focus:**
- [ ] Subject is YOU/Your/Client (or implied YOU)
- [ ] Copy states specific outcome client achieves
- [ ] Passes "So What?" test (client knows what they get)

**Word Precision:**
- [ ] Outcomes are measurable/concrete (60% approval, 10 min, platform-native)
- [ ] No vague benefits (better, improved, enhanced)
- [ ] No cringe words or hype language

**Emotional Resonance:**
- [ ] Connects to pain avoided OR aspiration achieved
- [ ] Avoids replacement fear (focus on outcomes)
- [ ] Tone matches humble mastery positioning

**If ANY dimension fails → REWRITE until all three pass**

## Common Copy Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Hero Section Rewrite

**Task:** Rewrite hero for [service] page

**Workflow:**
1. Identify service → determine primary outcome
2. Draft hero (5-15 words, tight YOU-outcome framing)
3. Draft subhead (outcome + proof + pain/aspiration)
4. Check Trinity framework (all 3 dimensions pass?)
5. Accuracy check (timeline, capability, metrics)
6. Anti-pattern detection (no violations?)
7. Service-specific validation (checklist passes?)

**Quality standard:** BriefingEngine.tsx hero (Cameron-approved benchmark)

### Scenario 2: Mid-Page CTA

**Task:** Write compelling CTA for [service]

**Workflow:**
1. Determine service + primary outcome
2. Draft CTA copy emphasizing outcome
3. Button text: action-oriented ("Start Your Brief", "Book a Studio Call")
4. Supporting copy: proof point + urgency/value
5. Trinity check + accuracy + anti-patterns

**Pattern:** [Outcome reinforcement] + [Proof point] + [CTA button]

### Scenario 3: FAQ Answer

**Task:** Write FAQ answer maintaining brand voice

**Workflow:**
1. Identify service FAQ relates to
2. Answer with outcome-first framing (what client achieves)
3. Provide accuracy (timelines, capabilities, metrics)
4. Avoid replacement language (if human/AI question)
5. Trinity check (especially User-Outcome Focus)

**Cameron's rule:** "Avoid the [human vs AI] question - focus on outcomes only"

### Scenario 4: Homepage Multi-Service Copy

**Task:** Homepage must represent ALL services without favoring one

**CRITICAL Homepage Hero Requirements:**
- **Lead with Masters positioning:** Emphasize AI mastery since 2023 (not service-specific)
- **Emphasize production quality:** "Production-ready AI solutions" positioning
- **Keep services ABSTRACT:** Do NOT list Studios/Briefing Engine/Conversational AI in hero
- **Universal outcomes:** What clients achieve regardless of service
- **Why:** Cre8tive has video (Studios, Briefing Engine) AND conversational AI - too diverse to lead with one service

**Workflow:**
1. **Hero:** Universal AI mastery theme + production quality emphasis (Masters vs Dabblers)
2. **Subhead:** Production-ready positioning, since 2023 proof point, abstract services
3. **Service sections (below hero):** Then break into service-specific outcomes with clear labels
4. **Accuracy check:** No cross-contamination between service sections

**Pattern:**
- **Hero = Universal mastery + production quality** (abstract, all services)
- **Service sections = Service-specific outcomes** (clearly separated)

**BAD Homepage Hero Examples:**
❌ "AI-powered Studio partners deliver platform-perfect campaigns" (Too Studios-specific)
❌ "Production-Ready AI, Mastered Since 2023" (Too technical/blunt, not premium B2B voice)
❌ "Revolutionary AI that transforms everything" (Generic hype, not outcome-focused)

**GOOD Homepage Hero Examples (Premium B2B AI Voice):**

**Option A (Partnership-first):**
**H1:** "Your AI production partner at enterprise scale"
**Subhead:** "From video to conversation, deploy solutions built for teams that take quality seriously. Trusted since 2023."

**Option B (Outcome-first):**
**H1:** "Turn vision into production at scale"
**Subhead:** "AI that understands your brand—video, conversation, results. Built for enterprises since 2023."

**Option C (Capability-first):**
**H1:** "The AI platform for enterprise production"
**Subhead:** "Deploy video and conversational AI across your organization with solutions mastered since 2023. Quality without compromise."

**Why these work (Premium B2B Characteristics):**
- ✅ Partnership language ("partner", "built for teams")
- ✅ Enterprise markers ("enterprise scale", "deploy across organization")
- ✅ Sophisticated simplicity (complex capability, clear language)
- ✅ Confident understatement ("Trusted since 2023" not "World's best")
- ✅ Your/your brand framing (client-centric)
- ✅ Services abstract ("video to conversation")
- ✅ Tier 1 vocabulary ("platform", "deploy", "built for")

## Premium B2B AI Voice (Critical for Cre8tive)

### What Makes Premium B2B SaaS Voice

**Cre8tive AI targets enterprise/B2B clients. Voice MUST sound premium, not consumer/generic.**

**Core Characteristics:**
1. **Confident understatement** (not hype): "Built for teams" not "Revolutionary platform"
2. **Outcome-focused with specificity**: "Deploy video at scale" not "Make better videos"
3. **Partnership language**: "Copilot", "partner", "built for" not "tool", "helper"
4. **Enterprise markers naturally integrated**: "Deploy across your organization" not "Use in your business"
5. **Your/your team framing**: Client-centric, not company-centric
6. **Sophisticated simplicity**: Complex capability described simply

### Vocabulary Tier System

**Tier 1 (Premium B2B - USE THESE):**
- platform, infrastructure, deploy, scale, enterprise-grade
- built for, copilot, partner, integrated
- your [data/brand/team/organization]
- understand, context, consistency
- protect, secure, governance

**Tier 2 (Professional - OK to use):**
- assistant, accelerate, streamline, trusted by
- solutions, capabilities

**Tier 3 (Consumer/Generic - AVOID):**
- tool, helper, widget
- easy, simple, anyone can
- revolutionary, game-changing, unlock the power
- all-in-one, future of

### Premium B2B Structure Patterns

**H1 Formula (5-12 words):**
```
[Action/Outcome] + [Qualifier] + [Audience/Context]
```

**Examples:**
- "Your AI production partner at enterprise scale" (8 words)
- "Turn vision into production at scale" (6 words)
- "The AI platform for enterprise production" (6 words)

**Subhead Formula (15-30 words):**
```
[Capability] + [Differentiation] + [Trust Signal] + [Outcome]
```

**Example:**
"From video to conversation, deploy solutions built for teams that take quality seriously. Trusted since 2023." (18 words)

### What Premium B2B AI Companies Emphasize

**DO Emphasize:**
- Integration, not replacement: "Copilot", "partner"
- Business outcomes: Productivity, scale, efficiency, quality
- Enterprise concerns: Security, compliance, brand consistency, governance
- Proven at scale: "Trusted by", customer counts
- Technical credibility: "Deploy", "integrate", "infrastructure"
- Your unique context: "Your brand", "your data", "your organization"

**DON'T Emphasize:**
- Technology details in hero (move to subpages)
- Price/accessibility (enterprise sales)
- Beginner-friendliness (assume sophistication)
- Feature lists (focus on outcomes)

### Tone Comparison

| Premium B2B ✅ | Generic/Consumer ❌ |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "Built for teams that take quality seriously" | "Easy to use for everyone" |
| "Deploy across your organization" | "Use in your business" |
| "AI that understands your brand" | "Smart AI assistant" |
| "Enterprise-grade security" | "Safe and secure" |
| "Your AI production partner" | "AI video tool" |
| "Trusted since 2023" | "The best AI platform" |

### Application for Cre8tive AI

**Homepage must sound premium B2B:**
- Use Tier 1 vocabulary ("platform", "deploy", "built for", "partner")
- Partnership positioning ("Your AI production partner")
- Enterprise markers ("at enterprise scale", "across your organization")
- Confident understatement ("Trusted since 2023", "built for teams")
- Abstract services ("video to conversation" not "Studios, Briefing Engine, Conversational AI")

**Service pages can be more specific:**
- Studios: "AI-powered Studio partners" (partnership explicit)
- But maintain premium B2B voice throughout

---

## Production-Ready Copy Lengths (Modern Premium B2B)

**CRITICAL:** Modern premium B2B (2024-2025) favors extreme brevity and micro-content chunking. Anthropic, OpenAI, and other premium AI companies use significantly shorter copy than older patterns.

### Homepage Heroes

**Standard:**
- **H1:** 3-7 words (max 10)
- **Subhead:** 15-25 words (max 30)
- **Total:** 20-35 words combined

**Example (approved):**
"Your AI partner for production at scale" (7 words) + "From video to conversation, deploy solutions built for teams that demand excellence. Trusted since 2023." (18 words) = 25 words total

### Service Descriptions

**Production lengths:**
- **Short overview:** 40-60 words
- **Standard section:** 60-100 words
- **Avoid:** Single blocks over 100 words

**Pattern:** Anthropic/OpenAI average 60-80 words per section, not 150-200

### Value Proposition Bullets

**Per bullet:**
- **Total:** 20-30 words (max 35)
- **Headline:** 3-6 words
- **Description:** 15-25 words

**Example:** "Deploy solutions built on AI mastery refined since 2023..." (27 words) ✅

### Capability Descriptions

**Per section:**
- **Total:** 60-90 words
- **Emotional hook:** 10-20 words
- **Proof body:** 40-70 words
- **Break 100+ word content into multiple chunks**

### The Micro-Content Pattern

Modern premium B2B breaks content into scannable chunks:

**❌ OLD (2020-2022):**
- One 200-word service description paragraph
- Dense blocks, low scannability

**✅ NEW (2024-2025):**
- 60-word intro
- 3 × 25-word benefits (75 words)
- 50-word CTA
- = 185 words total, 5 chunks, high scannability

**Real examples:**
- **Anthropic:** No text block exceeds ~80 words
- **OpenAI:** Most sections 40-60 words
- **Pattern:** Multiple short sections > single long blocks

### When Longer Copy Is Appropriate

**Comprehensive mode (100-150 words):**
- Initial content development
- Internal documentation
- Content to be edited down
- Testing comprehensive knowledge

**Production mode (60-100 words):**
- Final published copy
- Homepage/service pages
- Customer-facing materials
- **Modern premium B2B standard**

**Default rule:** Aim for concise production lengths. User can request comprehensive if needed.

### Copy Length Quick Reference

| Section Type | Production Target | Max | Pattern |
|--------------|------------------|-----|---------|
| Homepage hero | 25-30 words | 35 words | H1 (3-7w) + subhead (15-25w) |
| Service overview | 60-80 words | 100 words | 2-3 short paragraphs |
| Value prop bullet | 25 words | 30 words | Headline (3-6w) + desc (15-25w) |
| Capability section | 70-90 words | 100 words | Hook (10-20w) + proof (40-70w) |
| Feature detail | 50-70 words | 80 words | Single focused paragraph |

## Red Flags (When to HALT and Reassess)

**HALT immediately if you spot:**

🚨 **Automation/replacement language**
- "Automate video production"
- "No team needed"
- "Replace your agency"

🚨 **Timeline inaccuracy**
- "Video in minutes" (Studios takes days)
- "From brief to video in 10 minutes" (conflates storyboard + video)

🚨 **Service cross-contamination**
- BriefingEngine copy using Studios outcomes
- Homepage using Conversational AI outcome for video section

🚨 **Self-serve tool positioning**
- "Create videos yourself"
- "Easy-to-use platform"
- Implies client operates tool, not partnership

🚨 **Naming specific AI tools**
- Runway, Pika, Sora, etc.
- Tools evolve/become outdated, implies dependency

**When red flag detected → STOP → Consult relevant reference doc → REWRITE**

## Quality Benchmarks

### Cameron-Approved Standards

**For Studios Service Pages (from BriefingEngine.tsx):**

**Hero:**
"From Brief to Native Video"

**Subhead:**
"Hybrid AI and Studio turn imagination into platform-perfect campaigns—no agency juggling."

**Why this works for Studios pages:**
- ✅ YOU-outcome focus (client's journey: brief → video)
- ✅ Hybrid model explicit ("Hybrid AI and Studio")
- ✅ Specific outcome ("platform-perfect campaigns")
- ✅ Pain eliminated ("no agency juggling")
- ✅ No cringe words, no hype, humble confidence

**Use this calibration for Studios service page copy quality. For homepage, see below.**

---

**For Homepage (Universal Positioning):**

Homepage requires DIFFERENT positioning than Studios pages:
- **Universal AI mastery** (not service-specific)
- **Production quality** emphasis
- **Abstract services** ("video to conversation" not "Studios, Briefing Engine, Conversational AI")
- **Premium B2B voice** (Tier 1 vocabulary: platform, deploy, built for, partner)

**See these sections for homepage guidance:**
- "Homepage Multi-Service Copy" section (line ~332) for examples
- "Premium B2B AI Voice" section (line ~383) for voice characteristics

**DO NOT use "From Brief to Native Video" for homepage** - that's Studios-specific.

---

- [ ] Service-appropriate positioning (Studios ≠ BriefingEngine ≠ Conversational AI)
- [ ] Primary outcome emphasized (value hierarchy respected)
- [ ] Service-specific proof points used correctly

**If ALL 6 sections pass → APPROVE**
**If ANY section fails → REWRITE until all pass**

---

## When to Escalate to Cameron

**Seek Cameron's validation when:**

1. **Ambiguous service positioning** - Unclear which service owns an outcome
2. **New capability claims** - Unsure if Cre8tive can deliver what copy promises
3. **Subjective quality validation** - Objective checks pass, but unsure about emotional resonance
4. **Timeline/metric uncertainty** - New timeline or metric not documented in guardrails
5. **Competitive positioning edge case** - Unusual competitor comparison scenario

**Remember:** These guidelines provide objective framework, but Cameron's subjective validation is final authority on copy excellence.

---

## Success Criteria

**Cre8tive AI copy succeeds when:**

✅ **All THREE Trinity dimensions pass** (User-Outcome + Word Precision + Emotional Resonance)
✅ **Accuracy is flawless** (timelines, capabilities, metrics verified)
✅ **No anti-pattern violations** (CRITICAL and HIGH categories clean)
✅ **Service positioning is clear** (client knows what each service delivers)
✅ **USP integration is subtle** (masters positioning present, not loud)
✅ **Cameron validates it** (subjective resonance confirmed)

**Copy that satisfies objectives but fails any dimension → REWRITE until excellence achieved.**

---

## Skill Maintenance

**Version:** 1.0.0 (GREEN phase - initial creation)

**Expected evolution:**
- REFACTOR phase: Close loopholes found during testing
- Multi-model validation: Ensure works on Haiku/Sonnet/Opus
- Cameron feedback: Incorporate subjective quality refinements

**This skill is a living document - Cameron's expertise continues to refine positioning, and this skill evolves with it.**
