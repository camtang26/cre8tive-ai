# Accuracy Guardrails

## Purpose
Accuracy violations are CRITICAL failures that damage credibility and set false expectations. This document defines strict guardrails for timeline accuracy, capability boundaries, and metric verification.

**Severity:** Accuracy violations trigger immediate rejection, even if other quality dimensions pass.

---

## Timeline Accuracy (CRITICAL)

### The Problem (From Baseline Testing)

**Baseline violation (Scenario 1):**
"From brief to video in minutes"

**Why this is CRITICAL:**
- BriefingEngine delivers STORYBOARD in 10 minutes
- Studios delivers VIDEO in days-weeks
- Saying "video in minutes" = false promise, client disappointment

### Service-Specific Timelines

#### Studios Timeline

**What Studios DELIVERS:**
- Final platform-native video (TikTok, Reels, Shorts)

**Timeline:**
- **Days to weeks** (NOT hours, NOT minutes)

**Correct phrasing:**
✅ "Platform-native video delivered in days"
✅ "Video production in days, not weeks"
✅ "Final video delivered within days"

**FORBIDDEN phrasing:**
❌ "Video in minutes"
❌ "Instant video production"
❌ "Hours to final video"
❌ "Same-day video delivery"

**Why strict enforcement:**
- Production-ready video requires time (even with AI acceleration)
- Setting false "instant" expectations → client disappointment
- Hybrid AI+human model REQUIRES time for quality

#### BriefingEngine Timeline

**What BriefingEngine DELIVERS:**
- Production-ready storyboard (NOT final video)

**Timeline:**
- **10 minutes** (this IS accurate for storyboard)

**Correct phrasing:**
✅ "Storyboard in 10 minutes"
✅ "Lock creative direction in 10 minutes"
✅ "Production-ready storyboard under 10 minutes"

**FORBIDDEN phrasing:**
❌ "Video in 10 minutes" (NO - storyboard, not video)
❌ "Final production in 10 minutes"
❌ "End-to-end video in minutes"

**Why strict enforcement:**
- BriefingEngine outputs storyboard, Studios outputs video
- Conflating the two = accuracy violation + false expectations

#### Integrated Workflow Timeline (BriefingEngine → Studios)

**What happens:**
1. Brief → BriefingEngine
2. 10 minutes → Production-ready storyboard
3. Review/approve creative direction
4. Hand off to Studios
5. Days-weeks → Final video delivered

**Correct phrasing:**
✅ "Storyboard in 10 minutes, video in days"
✅ "Lock creative direction in 10 minutes, then hand off to Studios for video production"
✅ "From brief to storyboard (10 min) to platform-native video (days)"

**FORBIDDEN phrasing:**
❌ "From brief to video in 10 minutes"
❌ "End-to-end video production in under 10 minutes"
❌ "Complete video workflow in minutes"

**Why strict enforcement:**
- Integrated workflow has TWO stages with DIFFERENT timelines
- Clients need accurate expectations for TOTAL timeline (10 min + days)

#### Conversational AI Timeline

**What Conversational AI DELIVERS:**
- Scaled support capacity (ongoing, not one-time delivery)

**Timeline:**
- **24/7 availability** (continuous operation)
- Setup/deployment timeline TBD (confirm with Cameron if copy requires specifics)

**Correct phrasing:**
✅ "24/7 customer support"
✅ "Scale support without headcount"
✅ "Handle inquiries around the clock"

**Avoid overpromising:**
❌ "Instant deployment"
❌ "Set up in minutes"
(Unless confirmed by Cameron - timeline not specified in elicitation)

### Timeline Accuracy Checklist

Before approving ANY copy, verify:

- [ ] Studios copy says "days" for video (NEVER minutes/hours)
- [ ] BriefingEngine copy says "10 minutes" for storyboard (NEVER video)
- [ ] Integrated workflow distinguishes storyboard (10 min) from video (days)
- [ ] No conflating BriefingEngine and Studios timelines
- [ ] Conversational AI uses 24/7 availability (not instant setup)

**If ANY timeline is inaccurate → IMMEDIATE REWRITE before approval**

## Metric Verification (Proof Points Must Be Accurate)

### 60% First-Draft Approval Rate

**What this metric means:**
- Studios delivers production-ready video
- 60% of first deliveries approved by client WITHOUT revisions
- vs ~30% industry standard for traditional agencies

**Where to use:**
✅ Studios copy (primary quality proof point)
✅ Homepage (overall credibility)
✅ Comparisons to agencies

**Where NOT to use:**
❌ BriefingEngine copy (applies to video, not storyboards)
❌ Conversational AI copy (applies to video, not support)

**Accuracy requirements:**
- [ ] Only cited for Studios service
- [ ] Context provided (vs industry standard, if space allows)
- [ ] Not conflated with storyboard approval (BriefingEngine)

### 10-Minute Storyboard Delivery

**What this metric means:**
- BriefingEngine delivers production-ready storyboard
- Under 10 minutes from brief submission
- vs 2-5 days for traditional agency storyboards

**Where to use:**
✅ BriefingEngine copy (primary speed proof point)
✅ Comparisons to traditional agency briefing process

**Where NOT to use:**
❌ Studios copy (Studios timeline is days for video)
❌ When referring to final video delivery

**Accuracy requirements:**
- [ ] Only cited for storyboard delivery (NOT video)
- [ ] Context provided (vs 2-5 days traditional, if space allows)
- [ ] Not conflated with video production timeline

### Platform-Native Specialization (TikTok, Reels, Shorts)

**What this metric means:**
- Studios delivers video optimized for EACH platform
- TikTok ≠ Reels ≠ Shorts (each has unique format/language)
- Not generic video repurposed across platforms

**Where to use:**
✅ Studios copy (core differentiator)
✅ Homepage (service capability)

**Where NOT to use:**
❌ BriefingEngine copy (storyboards, not final video)
❌ Conversational AI copy (not video-related)

**Accuracy requirements:**
- [ ] Platforms listed: TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts
- [ ] "Native to each platform" framing (not "works on all platforms")
- [ ] No implication of generic multi-platform video

### Since 2023 (Mastery Timeline)

**What this metric means:**
- Cre8tive AI has been using/mastering AI video tech since 2023
- Years before mainstream AI video hype
- Early adoption = time advantage = mastery depth

**Per Cameron's correction:** Year is 2023 (NOT 2021 or other)

**Where to use:**
✅ All services (universal mastery proof point)
✅ Homepage (credibility)
✅ Comparisons to agencies (mastery vs experimentation)

**Accuracy requirements:**
- [ ] Year is 2023 (confirm with Cameron if uncertain)
- [ ] "Mastering" (ongoing) vs "mastered" (arrogant finality)
- [ ] Humble tone (not "pioneers", "first", "original")

### Metric Accuracy Checklist

Before citing ANY metric, verify:

- [ ] Metric is accurate for the service (60% approval = Studios only)
- [ ] Timeline is correct (10 min = storyboard, days = video)
- [ ] Platform list is current (TikTok, Reels, Shorts)
- [ ] Year is accurate (2023 for mastery timeline)
- [ ] Context provided (vs industry standard, if space allows)

**If ANY metric is inaccurate → IMMEDIATE REWRITE**

## Service Cross-Contamination Prevention

### The Problem (From Baseline Testing)

**Baseline violation:**
Homepage using "scale without headcount" (Conversational AI's outcome) when it should focus on Studios outcomes

**Why this is accuracy violation:**
- Clients expect service delivers outcome mentioned
- Cross-contamination confuses which service does what
- False expectations → client disappointment

### Service Outcome Ownership

**Quick reference:**

| Outcome | Service | Timeline |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Platform-native video | Studios | Days |
| 60% first-draft approval | Studios | Days (video) |
| Scale video production without headcount | Studios | Days (video) |
| Lock creative direction in 10 minutes | BriefingEngine | 10 min (storyboard) |
| Production-ready storyboards | BriefingEngine | 10 min |
| Eliminate briefing back-and-forth | BriefingEngine | 10 min (storyboard) |
| Scale support without headcount | Conversational AI | 24/7 |
| 24/7 customer experience | Conversational AI | Continuous |

### Service Cross-Contamination Checklist

Before approving copy, verify:

- [ ] Outcomes match service (Studios ≠ BriefingEngine ≠ Conversational AI)
- [ ] No video outcomes for BriefingEngine copy
- [ ] No storyboard outcomes for Studios copy
- [ ] No video/storyboard outcomes for Conversational AI copy
- [ ] No support outcomes for Studios/BriefingEngine copy

**If cross-contamination detected → REWRITE with correct service outcomes**

## Overpromising Prevention (What to NEVER Claim)

### Technology Claims to AVOID

**NEVER claim:**
❌ "Revolutionary AI technology"
❌ "Cutting-edge machine learning"
❌ "Most advanced AI in the industry"
❌ "Proprietary AI algorithms"

**Why:** Generic hype language (see anti-patterns.md), not verifiable, not outcome-focused

**Instead, focus on:**
✅ Outcomes (60% approval, 10 min storyboards, platform-native)
✅ Mastery proof (since 2023, cinematography-trained AI)
✅ Specific differentiators (hybrid model, platform-native specialization)

### Superlative Claims to AVOID

**NEVER claim:**
❌ "World's best AI video production"
❌ "Industry-leading conversational AI"
❌ "#1 platform for..."
❌ "First to market with..."

**Why:** Unverifiable, arrogant tone, not humble mastery

**Instead, focus on:**
✅ Specific proof points (60% approval, since 2023)
✅ Humble mastery ("We've been mastering since 2023")
✅ Measurable outcomes (platform-native, 10 min, days not weeks)

### Replacement Claims to AVOID

**NEVER claim:**
❌ "Replace your agency"
❌ "Eliminate your production team"
❌ "No human involvement needed"
❌ "Fully automated video production"

**Why:** Triggers replacement fear, misrepresents partnership model (see anti-patterns.md)

**Instead, focus on:**
✅ Partnership/augmentation ("AI-powered Studio partners")
✅ Scaling without headcount growth
✅ Outcomes achieved WITH Cre8tive partnership

### Instant Results Claims to AVOID

**NEVER claim:**
❌ "Instant video production" (Studios takes days)
❌ "Real-time video generation" (inaccurate timeline)
❌ "Immediate deployment" (Conversational AI timeline TBD)

**Why:** Timeline accuracy violations, sets false expectations

**Instead, focus on:**
✅ Accurate timelines (10 min storyboards, days for video)
✅ Speed RELATIVE to alternatives (days not weeks, 10 min vs 2-5 days)
✅ Quality maintained despite speed (60% approval)

### Overpromising Prevention Checklist

Before approving copy, verify:

- [ ] No "revolutionary"/"cutting-edge" tech claims
- [ ] No unverifiable superlatives (#1, best, leading)
- [ ] No replacement language (eliminate team, no humans needed)
- [ ] No instant/immediate timeline claims (unless accurate)
- [ ] All claims backed by specific proof points

**If ANY overpromise detected → REWRITE with accurate, humble claims**

## Accuracy Violation Response Protocol

### If You Spot an Accuracy Violation

**Step 1: HALT - Do not approve copy**

**Step 2: Identify violation type:**
- Timeline inaccuracy (minutes vs days, storyboard vs video)
- Capability boundary violation (service does X when it doesn't)
- Metric misuse (60% approval cited for BriefingEngine)
- Service cross-contamination (Studios outcome for BriefingEngine)
- Overpromising (revolutionary claims, instant results)

**Step 3: REWRITE with accurate information:**
- Consult this document for correct timeline/capability
- Verify metrics match service
- Remove overpromising language
- Add context/specificity to prevent ambiguity

**Step 4: Re-check against accuracy guardrails**

**Step 5: If uncertain, escalate to Cameron for validation**

### Common Accuracy Violation Patterns (From Baseline)

**Violation 1: Timeline conflation**
❌ "From brief to video in minutes"
✅ "Storyboard in 10 minutes, video in days"

**Violation 2: Service capability confusion**
❌ "BriefingEngine delivers platform-native video"
✅ "BriefingEngine delivers production-ready storyboards for Studios to execute"

**Violation 3: Metric misattribution**
❌ "BriefingEngine storyboards achieve 60% approval"
✅ "Studios video achieves 60% first-draft approval"

**Violation 4: Overpromising speed**
❌ "Instant AI-powered video production"
✅ "Platform-native video delivered in days, not weeks"

**Violation 5: Service cross-contamination**
❌ Homepage: "Scale support without headcount" (when talking about video)
✅ Homepage Studios section: "Scale video production without headcount" OR Conversational AI section: "Scale support without headcount"
