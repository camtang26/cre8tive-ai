# Cre8tive AI Copy Anti-Patterns

## Purpose
This document catalogs CRITICAL quality violations observed in baseline testing and Cameron's feedback. These patterns trigger immediate rejection and must be actively avoided.

---

## Category 1: AI Hype Language (Cringe Words)

### The Problem
Generic AI marketing language that sounds like every other AI company. Undermines premium positioning and triggers skepticism.

### Forbidden/Overused Words
**Tier 1 (NEVER use):**
- "Revolutionary" / "revolutionize"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "Unleash" / "unlock"
- "Ignite"
- "Automate" / "automation" (triggers replacement fear)

**Tier 2 (Avoid overuse - max 1x per page):**
- "Transform" / "transformation" (becomes crutch word)
  - Baseline evidence: Used 5 times across 6 scenarios
  - Alternative: "elevate", "deliver", "achieve", or specific outcome
- "Simple" / "easy"
  - Undermines the mastery positioning
  - Alternative: Focus on outcomes, not effort

**Tier 3 (Context-dependent):**
- "Powerful" - OK if describing client outcomes, not our tech
- "Innovative" - Only if backed by specific proof point

### Detection Pattern
If you write a sentence with 2+ words from Tier 1-2, REWRITE immediately.

**Bad:** "Revolutionary AI automates video production, transforming your workflow"
**Good:** "Platform-native video delivered in days, not weeks"

## Category 2: Automation/Replacement Framing

### The Problem
Language that implies Cre8tive AI replaces humans triggers fear and misrepresents the hybrid model.

### Violation Patterns
❌ "Automate your video production"
❌ "No more agencies needed"
❌ "Eliminate production costs"
❌ "Replace your creative team"
❌ "Hands-free video creation"

### Why This Fails
- Triggers replacement anxiety (job loss fear)
- Misrepresents Cre8tive as self-serve tool
- Contradicts "AI-powered Studio partners" positioning
- Ignores the human expertise that ensures quality

### Correct Framing
**Strategy:** Avoid the human/AI question entirely - focus on outcomes

✅ "Platform-native video delivered in days"
✅ "60% first-draft approval rate"
✅ "AI-powered Studio partners" (hybrid model for Studios only)
✅ "Scale support without headcount" (Conversational AI ONLY)

**Rule:** Never position as "removing" humans. Position as "elevating" outcomes.

---

## Category 3: Self-Serve Tool Positioning

### The Problem
Implying Cre8tive AI is a platform users operate themselves, rather than a service/partnership.

### Violation Patterns
❌ "Easy-to-use platform"
❌ "Create videos yourself"
❌ "Self-serve AI video generator"
❌ "No technical skills required"
❌ "Anyone can create professional videos"

### Why This Fails
- Contradicts production studio partnership model
- Positions against AI video generators (wrong competitive set)
- Undermines "masters vs dabblers" positioning
- Ignores the expertise that drives quality

### Correct Framing
✅ "AI-powered Studio partners" (Studios)
✅ "Hand off to our Studio for video delivery"
✅ "Production-ready storyboards before Studio execution"

**Rule:** Studios is a PARTNER, Briefing Engine is a TOOL that enables partnership. Never imply pure self-serve for video.

---

## Category 4: Technology-First Framing

### The Problem
Leading with what the AI DOES instead of what the CLIENT ACHIEVES. Classic feature-first mistake.

### Violation Patterns
❌ "Our AI analyzes your brief and generates storyboards"
❌ "Advanced cinematography algorithms create professional shots"
❌ "Machine learning optimizes platform performance"
❌ "Our technology understands TikTok best practices"

### Why This Fails
- Violates User-Outcome Focus (Trinity framework)
- Client doesn't care HOW, they care WHAT RESULT
- Positions Cre8tive as a tech company, not outcome partner
- "Masters vs dabblers" is about outcomes, not tech specs

### Correct Framing
✅ "Lock creative direction in 10 minutes" (not "AI generates storyboards in 10 minutes")
✅ "Platform-native video that performs" (not "AI optimizes for each platform")
✅ "60% first-draft approval rate" (proof of outcome, not process)

**Rule:** Outcome-specific language (concrete on results, vague on methodology - EXCEPT Studios where hybrid model IS the differentiator)

---

## Category 5: Naming Specific AI Tools

### The Problem
Referencing tools like Runway, Pika, Sora, etc. dates the positioning and implies limitations.

### Why This Fails (Per Cameron)
- "I don't even use those as they are bad by today's standards"
- Tool landscape evolves rapidly (what's current now is outdated in months)
- Naming tools implies dependency/limitations
- Reveals proprietary stack unnecessarily

### Correct Framing
✅ "Cinematographer vs camera company" metaphor (don't name cameras)
✅ "We master generative AI tools to deliver production-ready outcomes"
✅ "Platform-native video" (outcome, not tool)

**Rule:** NEVER name specific AI video generation tools. Stay tool-agnostic in positioning.

---

## Category 6: Methodology Over Outcomes (Except Studios)

### The Problem
Explaining HOW we work instead of WHAT client achieves. Wastes premium copy real estate.

### When This Violates
For BriefingEngine and Conversational AI copy: Don't explain process details

❌ "Our AI uses cinematography principles to analyze your brief, then applies platform-specific templates..."
❌ "The Briefing Engine guides you through 5 steps..."

### Exception: Studios
Studios DOES emphasize hybrid "AI-powered Studio partners" model - the methodology IS the differentiator here.

✅ "Hybrid AI and Studio turn imagination into platform-perfect campaigns"

### Correct Default Pattern
Lead with outcome, minimize process:

✅ "Lock creative direction in 10 minutes" (BriefingEngine)
✅ "Scale support without headcount" (Conversational AI)

**Rule:** Outcome-specific everywhere. Studios is the ONLY service where hybrid model gets explicit emphasis.

---

## Category 7: Generic Features vs Specific Outcomes

### The Problem
Vague benefits that could apply to any service, rather than concrete results.

### Baseline Violations (From Testing)
❌ "Elevate your marketing"
❌ "Engage your audience"
❌ "Boost your brand presence"
❌ "Drive better results"
❌ "Streamline your workflow"

### Why This Fails
- Violates Word Choice Precision (Trinity framework)
- Could be said by any competitor
- No proof, no specificity, no credibility

### Correct Framing
Replace vague benefits with concrete outcomes:

✅ "60% first-draft approval rate" (not "better quality")
✅ "Platform-native video delivered in days" (not "faster production")
✅ "10-minute storyboards before Studio handoff" (not "streamlined workflow")

**Rule:** If a competitor could say it, it's too vague. Make it specific to Cre8tive AI's measurable outcomes.

---

## Category 8: Weak Verbs & Passive Voice

### The Problem
Passive constructions and weak verbs undermine premium positioning.

### Violation Patterns
❌ "Videos are created by our AI-powered Studio"
❌ "Your content will be optimized for each platform"
❌ "Storyboards can be generated in minutes"

### Why This Fails
- Passive voice = weak, bureaucratic tone
- "Can be" / "will be" = uncertainty, not confidence
- Doesn't match "masters" positioning

### Correct Framing
Active voice, strong verbs, confident present tense:

✅ "AI-powered Studio partners deliver platform-native video"
✅ "Lock creative direction in 10 minutes"
✅ "You receive production-ready storyboards before Studio handoff"

**Rule:** Active voice, present tense, strong verbs. No "can be", "will be", "are created by".

- [ ] Outcome-first, not technology-first
- [ ] No specific AI tool names (Runway, Pika, Sora, etc.)
- [ ] Methodology vague EXCEPT Studios hybrid model
- [ ] No generic benefits - all outcomes are specific/measurable
- [ ] Active voice, strong verbs, confident tone

**Cameron's Final Authority:** When in doubt, these guidelines defer to Cameron's subjective validation. Excellence requires both objective compliance AND subjective resonance.
