# User-Outcome Framing

## Purpose
User-Outcome Focus is the FIRST dimension of the Trinity Framework - Cameron's #1 quality check. This document defines how to frame copy around what the CLIENT achieves (YOU), not what Cre8tive AI provides (WE).

---

## The Trinity Framework (Context)

**Three Equally Important Dimensions:**
1. **User-Outcome Focus** (this document) - YOU achieve vs WE provide
2. **Word Choice Precision** (specific not vague)
3. **Emotional Resonance** (pain/aspiration connection)

**Cameron's Validation:** "Word choice precision is first quality check"

All three must be satisfied for copy to pass. This document focuses on dimension #1.

---

## Core Principle: YOU Achieve vs WE Provide

### The Pattern

**Bad (WE-focused):**
"We deliver platform-native video"
"Our AI creates production-ready storyboards"
"We help you scale video production"

**Good (YOU-focused):**
"You deploy platform-perfect campaigns"
"Lock creative direction in 10 minutes"
"Scale video production without scaling headcount"

### Why This Matters

**WE-focused copy:**
- Makes Cre8tive AI the hero (wrong)
- Reads like every other B2B service
- Client is passive recipient
- Focuses on features, not outcomes

**YOU-focused copy:**
- Makes CLIENT the hero (correct)
- Positions Cre8tive as enabler/partner
- Client is active achiever
- Focuses on results they get

---

## The "YOU" Framework (Copy Audit Tool)

### Step 1: Identify the Subject

Every sentence has a subject. Who is achieving the outcome?

**WE/Our/Cre8tive AI subject = RED FLAG:**
- "We deliver..."
- "Our platform provides..."
- "Cre8tive AI helps you..."

**YOU/Your/Client subject = GOOD:**
- "You deploy..."
- "Your team achieves..."
- "Lock creative direction..." (implied YOU)

### Step 2: Convert WE → YOU

**Pattern:** [WE action] → [YOU outcome]

**Example 1:**
- WE: "We create platform-native video"
- YOU: "Deploy platform-perfect campaigns"

**Example 2:**
- WE: "Our AI generates storyboards in 10 minutes"
- YOU: "Lock creative direction in 10 minutes"

**Example 3:**
- WE: "We deliver 60% first-draft approval"
- YOU: "Get production-ready video with 60% first-draft approval"

### Step 3: Test with "So What?" Question

Ask: "So what does the client GET/ACHIEVE?"

If your copy answers with Cre8tive's action, not client's outcome → REWRITE

**Example:**
- Copy: "We use AI to analyze your brief"
- So what? → "You get... what?" (no clear outcome)
- REWRITE: "Lock creative direction in 10 minutes"

## Proven Quality Standards (From Cameron-Approved Copy)

### Example 1: BriefingEngine Hero (Cameron Approved)

**Hero:** "From Brief to Native Video"
**Subhead:** "Hybrid AI and Studio turn imagination into platform-perfect campaigns—no agency juggling."

**Why This Works (YOU-outcome analysis):**
- ✅ "From Brief to Native Video" = client's journey (their before → after)
- ✅ "platform-perfect campaigns" = client's outcome (what they deploy)
- ✅ "no agency juggling" = client's pain eliminated (what they avoid)
- ✅ Minimal WE/Our language - Cre8tive is enabler, client is hero

### Example 2: Conversational AI Outcome

**Outcome:** "Scale support without headcount"

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ "YOU scale" (implied subject)
- ✅ Specific outcome (support capacity)
- ✅ Specific constraint avoided (without headcount)
- ✅ No "We help you" or "Our AI enables" framing

---

## Common Violations (From Baseline Testing)

### Violation 1: "We Help You" Pattern

**Baseline example:** "We help you transform your video production workflow"

**Why it fails:**
- "We help" makes Cre8tive the subject
- "Transform" is vague (what's the actual outcome?)
- "Workflow" is internal process, not client-facing result

**Correct:** "Deploy platform-native campaigns in days, not weeks"

### Violation 2: "Our Platform Does X" Pattern

**Baseline example:** "Our AI-powered platform delivers professional video content"

**Why it fails:**
- "Our platform" is the subject
- "Delivers" describes Cre8tive's action, not client's outcome
- Client is passive recipient

**Correct:** "You deploy production-ready video to TikTok, Reels, Shorts"

### Violation 3: Feature-First Pattern

**Baseline example:** "AI-trained on cinematography principles creates platform-optimized content"

**Why it fails:**
- Feature ("AI-trained on cinematography") leads
- No clear client outcome stated
- Client isn't in the sentence at all

**Correct:** "Get platform-native video with 60% first-draft approval" (outcome first, cinematography training is implied by quality)

### Violation 4: "Enables You To" Pattern

**Baseline example:** "Cre8tive AI enables you to create professional video at scale"

**Why it fails:**
- "Cre8tive AI enables" = WE subject
- "Create professional video" is vague (what KIND of professional video?)
- "At scale" is buzzword, not specific outcome

**Correct:** "Scale video production without scaling headcount" (YOU scale, specific constraint)

---

## Outcome-Specific Language (Integration with Word Precision)

### Cameron's Rule
"Outcome-specific: Specific about results, vague about methodology"

This integrates User-Outcome Focus (dimension #1) with Word Choice Precision (dimension #2).

### What "Outcome-Specific" Means

**Not just YOU-focused, but SPECIFICALLY what you achieve:**

**Vague outcomes (AVOID):**
- "Better video content" (better how?)
- "Improved marketing" (improved how?)
- "Enhanced engagement" (enhanced how?)

**Specific outcomes (GOOD):**
- "60% first-draft approval rate" (measurable quality)
- "Platform-native video in days" (specific deliverable + timeline)
- "Scale support without headcount" (specific capacity + constraint)

### Pattern: YOU + SPECIFIC OUTCOME + CONSTRAINT/CONTEXT

**Formula:** [YOU] + [specific measurable outcome] + [specific constraint avoided OR context]

**Examples:**
1. "Lock creative direction in 10 minutes" = YOU lock + specific outcome (creative direction) + specific timeframe (10 min)
2. "Deploy platform-perfect campaigns—no agency juggling" = YOU deploy + specific outcome (platform-perfect) + constraint avoided (no juggling)
3. "Scale support without headcount" = YOU scale + specific outcome (support capacity) + constraint avoided (no headcount)

## Service-Specific Outcome Framing

### Studios: Platform-Native Video Outcomes

**Primary outcomes:**
- Deploy platform-perfect campaigns
- Get production-ready video in days
- Achieve 60% first-draft approval
- Scale video production without scaling headcount

**Avoid (WE-focused):**
- "We deliver platform-native video"
- "Our Studio creates TikTok/Reels content"
- "Cre8tive AI produces professional videos"

### BriefingEngine: Creative Direction Outcomes

**Primary outcomes:**
- Lock creative direction in 10 minutes
- Get production-ready storyboards before Studio handoff
- Eliminate days of briefing back-and-forth

**Value Hierarchy (Per Cameron):**
1. Studio-ready quality (enables handoff)
2. Speed to alignment (10 min vs days)
3. Strategic clarity (better decisions upfront)

**Avoid (WE-focused):**
- "Our AI generates storyboards in 10 minutes"
- "Briefing Engine analyzes your brief"
- "We help you visualize concepts quickly"

### Conversational AI: Support Scaling Outcomes

**Primary outcome:**
- Scale support without headcount

**Avoid (WE-focused):**
- "Our conversational AI handles customer inquiries"
- "We provide 24/7 automated support"
- "Cre8tive AI helps you respond faster"

---

## Emotional Resonance Integration (Trinity Dimension #3)

User-Outcome Focus connects to Emotional Resonance through pain/aspiration framing.

### Pain Points (What Client Avoids)

**Pattern:** YOU achieve [outcome]—no [pain point]

**Examples:**
- "Platform-perfect campaigns—no agency juggling" (eliminates coordination overhead)
- "Lock creative direction in 10 minutes" (eliminates days of back-and-forth)
- "Scale support without headcount" (eliminates hiring bottleneck)

### Aspirations (What Client Becomes)

**Pattern:** YOU [elevated state]

**Examples:**
- "You deploy campaigns that perform" (aspiration: performance, not just creation)
- "Your vision, production-ready" (aspiration: vision realized, not stuck in concept)

### Avoid Explicitly Calling Out Fears

**Cameron's Rule:** "Avoid the [human vs AI] question - focus on outcomes only"

**Don't say:**
❌ "No job losses"
❌ "Your team won't be replaced"
❌ "Don't worry about AI taking over"

**Instead, focus on positive outcomes:**
✅ "Scale video production without scaling headcount"
✅ "AI-powered Studio partners" (partnership, not replacement)

---

## Copy Length & YOU-Outcome Focus

### Hero Copy: Tight YOU-Outcome Framing

**Cameron's Preference:** "Hero tight (5-15 words)"

Short heroes MUST lead with YOU-outcome, no room for WE-features.

**Good heroes:**
- "From Brief to Native Video" (7 words, client journey)
- "Lock creative direction in 10 minutes" (6 words, client outcome)
- "Scale support without headcount" (4 words, client outcome)

**Bad heroes (even if short):**
- "AI-Powered Video Production" (feature, not outcome)
- "Professional Content Creation Platform" (WE-focused, no outcome)

### Body Copy: YOU-Outcome Can Breathe

**Cameron's Rule:** "Body can breathe if earned"

Longer body copy CAN include more context, but YOU-outcome must still be clear.

**Good body pattern:**
[YOU outcome] + [specific proof point] + [context/how it works]

**Example:**
"Deploy platform-perfect campaigns with 60% first-draft approval. AI-powered Studio partners deliver TikTok, Reels, and Shorts in days—no agency juggling."

- ✅ YOU outcome leads ("Deploy...")
- ✅ Proof point follows (60% approval)
- ✅ Context/how last (Studio partners, timeline)

## Testing Checklist: Is This Copy YOU-Outcome Focused?

Run every piece of copy through this checklist:

### Question 1: Who is the subject?
- [ ] Subject is YOU/Your/Client (or implied YOU)
- [ ] NOT: Subject is WE/Our/Cre8tive AI

### Question 2: What does client ACHIEVE?
- [ ] Copy states specific outcome client gets
- [ ] NOT: Copy describes what Cre8tive provides

### Question 3: Is outcome specific or vague?
- [ ] Outcome is measurable/concrete (60% approval, 10 minutes, platform-native)
- [ ] NOT: Vague benefits (better, improved, enhanced)

### Question 4: Does it pass the "So What?" test?
- [ ] If client asks "So what do I get?", answer is CLEAR
- [ ] NOT: Answer is unclear or requires explanation

### Question 5: Is pain/aspiration clear?
- [ ] Copy connects to what client avoids OR achieves
- [ ] NOT: Generic benefits with no emotional hook

**If ANY question fails, REWRITE toward YOU-outcome framing.**

---

## Advanced Pattern: Implied YOU

Sometimes the most powerful YOU-outcome framing is implied, not explicit.

### Pattern: Active Verb + Outcome (YOU Implied)

**Examples:**
- "Lock creative direction in 10 minutes" (YOU lock)
- "Deploy platform-perfect campaigns" (YOU deploy)
- "Scale support without headcount" (YOU scale)

**Why this works:**
- Tighter, more confident than "You can lock..."
- Active voice, strong verb
- Client naturally reads themselves into the action

**Avoid weaker versions:**
❌ "You can lock creative direction"
❌ "Able to deploy campaigns"
❌ "Helps you scale support"

---

## Integration with Other Trinity Dimensions

### User-Outcome + Word Precision

**Both required:**
- ✅ YOU-focused AND specific outcome
- ❌ YOU-focused BUT vague outcome ("You get better results")
- ❌ Specific outcome BUT WE-focused ("We deliver 60% approval")

**Example of both:**
"Deploy platform-native video with 60% first-draft approval"
- ✅ YOU deploy (outcome-focused)
- ✅ Platform-native, 60% approval (specific/precise)

### User-Outcome + Emotional Resonance

**Both required:**
- ✅ YOU-focused AND pain/aspiration connection
- ❌ YOU-focused BUT no emotional hook
- ❌ Emotional BUT features-focused

**Example of both:**
"Lock creative direction in 10 minutes—no more days of briefing back-and-forth"
- ✅ YOU lock (outcome-focused)
- ✅ Eliminates days of pain (emotional resonance)

---

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I ever use "We" or "Our"?

**A:** Sparingly, and only AFTER establishing YOU-outcome first.

**Good pattern:**
"Deploy platform-perfect campaigns. Our AI-powered Studio partners deliver in days, not weeks."
- ✅ YOU outcome leads
- ✅ WE/Our provides context/credibility

**Bad pattern:**
"Our AI-powered Studio partners deliver platform-perfect campaigns in days."
- ❌ WE leads, YOU is passive recipient

### Q: What about "helping" language?

**A:** Avoid "We help you" framing - it makes Cre8tive the subject.

**Bad:** "We help you create better video"
**Good:** "Create platform-native video with 60% first-draft approval"

### Q: How do I talk about Cre8tive's capabilities?

**A:** Frame capabilities as ENABLERS of client outcomes, not the main subject.

**Pattern:** [YOU outcome] + [enabled by Cre8tive capability]

**Example:**
"Lock creative direction in 10 minutes—AI trained on cinematography principles surfaces production decisions early"
- ✅ YOU outcome leads
- ✅ Cre8tive capability supports (explains HOW outcome is possible)

---

## Final Principle

**Cameron's Authority:** When copy feels uncertain about YOU vs WE framing, ask:

"Who is the hero of this sentence - the CLIENT or Cre8tive AI?"

If Cre8tive AI is the hero → REWRITE to make client the hero.

**The client achieves. Cre8tive AI enables. Never reverse this.**
