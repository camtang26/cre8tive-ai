## Questions & Responses Summary

**Primary Focus**: Both creating new visuals (7 Complete Credit Cycle) AND improving existing (hero, problem, Skor)

**Visual Types Needed**: Interactive product mockups, Animated sequences, Illustration/diagram style (hybrid)

**Quality Issues**: Visual polish, Typography/spacing, Animation quality, Data realism

**Scope**: General premium landing pages (not limited to fintech)

**Emotional Quality**: Sophisticated power - impressive but controlled

**Animation Feel**: Smooth acceleration (expo.inOut) - like premium car

**Trustworthiness**: Animations serve clarity, Data must be realistic

**Step Visualization**: Hybrid - Steps 1,3,4,7 (UI mockups), Steps 2,5,6 (illustrative)

**Typography Issues**: Font sizes too small, Font colors unreadable (dark on blue gradient)

**Skor Polish Needs**: Transition timing off, Auto-scroll jerky, Phase transitions too short

**Anti-Patterns**: Inconsistent spacing, Reusing same components even when criticized

**Success Validation**: Visual gut check ("I'll know it when I see it")

**Font Preferences**: Inter - improve execution; CRITICAL: COLOR!! Dark grey on blue = AWFUL

**Build Fresh Rules**: Aggressive fresh building bias - ALWAYS for landing showcases

**Text Color**: Near-white, pure-white, or TEAL (third brand color)

**Copy Plan Interpretation**: Teach Claude to read Fullpage-copy-plan.md and choose visualization type

## Requirements Summary

### Domain Context
- Pre-launch B2B fintech landing page for CashFlo AI
- Audience: Conservative finance buyers
- Purpose: Newsletter waitlist + showcase Skor (working product proof)
- Stage: Product doesn't exist yet; sophistication through premium mockups

### User Preferences

**Style & Approach**:
- "Museum-grade" = Sophisticated power (impressive but controlled)
- Restraint over flash
- Technical precision (60fps, perfect timing)
- Conservative fintech aesthetic
- Commands attention through quality, not noise

**Technical Preferences**:
- expo.inOut easing (smooth acceleration)
- 60fps performance mandatory
- Inter font (improve application)
- Text color: White/near-white/teal ONLY (dark grey on blue = FORBIDDEN)
- Systematic spacing (4px grid)
- **Aggressive fresh building bias** (never reuse primitives for landing)

### Quality Criteria

**Objective**:
- 60fps animations
- High contrast text (≥7:1)
- Systematic spacing (4px base)
- expo.inOut easing
- Realistic demo data (varied patterns)

**Subjective**:
- "Sophisticated power" feel (restrained yet impressive)
- Commands attention through quality
- Conservative but not boring
- Trustworthiness first
- Visual gut check primary

### Anti-Patterns

1. **CRITICAL**: Reusing existing components when user criticizes them
2. **CRITICAL**: Dark text colors on blue gradients
3. Mechanical animations (power2.out feels robotic)
4. Inconsistent spacing (random pixels)
5. Fake-looking demo data
6. Decorative animations (motion must serve clarity)

### Success Indicators

**Primary**: Visual gut check ("I'll know it when I see it")

**Secondary**:
- Feels like "sophisticated power"
- Conservative B2B buyers would trust it
- 60fps smooth animations
- Text immediately readable
- Data looks realistic

### 7 Complete Credit Cycle Steps - Visualization Strategy

| Step | Type | Visual Approach |
|------|------|-----------------|
| 1. Score | Realistic UI | Dashboard showing 100+ data points |
| 2. Connect | Illustrative | Integration diagram with REAL Xero/QB logos |
| 3. Monitor | Realistic UI | Risk dashboard with daily assessment |
| 4. Prioritize | Realistic UI | Worklist with plain English reasons |
| 5. Act | Illustrative | Multi-channel flow (email/SMS/voice) |
| 6. Escalate | Illustrative | Approval workflow with human-in-loop |
| 7. Prove | Realistic UI | Metrics dashboard (DSO trends) |

### Current Component Issues

1. **Hero Section**: AA confidence score animation broken, animations mechanical, typography cramped, text low contrast
2. **Problem Statement**: Needs elevation to museum-grade
3. **Complete Credit Cycle**: NO VISUALS EXIST (7 steps need custom visualizations)
4. **Try Skor Animation**: Transition timing off, auto-scroll jerky, pacing inconsistent

## Claude's Analysis

### Key Takeaways
1. Aggressive fresh building bias: NEVER reuse primitives for landing
2. Text readability critical: White/near-white/teal ONLY
3. Animation precision: expo.inOut + purposeful motion + 60fps
4. Sophisticated power through restraint: Quality and precision, not flash
5. Trustworthiness first: Realistic data, conservative aesthetic

### Themes & Patterns
- Quality over quantity: Every detail matters more than features
- Build fresh philosophy: Existing components for apps, not premium landing
- Purposeful motion: Animations serve clarity, never decoration
- Visual gut check: User recognizes premium instinctively
- "High-end premium" test: Ask this question for every decision

### Implications for Skill Design

**For Test Scenarios**: Must catch reuse of primitives, dark text on gradient, mechanical timing

**For Research Areas**: GSAP mastery, premium UI patterns, typography systems, text contrast rules, build fresh decisions, fintech benchmarks

**For SKILL.md Content**: "Build Fresh Rules" section, text color standards, expo.inOut as default, "Sophisticated Power" definition, copy plan interpretation

**For Quality Validation**: User's visual gut check is primary arbiter, technical checklist secondary, "sophisticated power" feel check, "high-end premium" thought exercise
