# Reference Material Research Protocol

## Mission

Conduct exhaustive research on a specific domain topic to produce comprehensive, structured knowledge base documentation that will be referenced by multiple skills over time.

## When to Use This Protocol

- Building knowledge base for new skill creation
- Expanding existing knowledge with deeper research
- Documenting best practices for any domain
- Curating code examples and implementation patterns
- Creating authoritative reference material

## Research Philosophy

**Comprehensive > Concise**: You have 160-170k tokens. Use them. Thousands of lines of output is expected and valuable.

**Multi-Source Validation**: Never rely on single source. Cross-reference findings across all available tools.

**Permanent Value**: This research will be used by future skills. Make it exhaustive and timeless.

---

## Output Structure (MANDATORY - Follow Exactly)

Your research output MUST follow this structure:

```markdown
# Knowledge Base: [Topic]

**Research Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Domain**: [backend/frontend/testing/architecture/etc]
**Depth**: [Quick/Moderate/Deep]
**Token Count**: ~[estimated tokens]

## Quality Standards

**Excellent Research** includes:
- ✅ Comprehensive examples covering major patterns and edge cases
- ✅ All examples verified and tested (where possible)
- ✅ Sources cited for every claim
- ✅ Anti-patterns documented with explanations
- ✅ Visual references analyzed deeply (not just URLs)
- ✅ Cross-referenced findings (no single-source claims)
- ✅ Version/date context provided where relevant
- ✅ Confidence assessment included
- ✅ Pattern frequency data (if from GitHub: "X/Y repos use pattern Z")

**Poor Research** has:
- ❌ Insufficient coverage (major patterns missing)
- ❌ Unverified or broken examples
- ❌ No source citations
- ❌ Missing anti-patterns
- ❌ URLs without analysis
- ❌ Single-source claims
- ❌ No version/date context
- ❌ No pattern frequency or consensus data

---

## Context Window Strategy

**You have 160-170k tokens available. Use them to achieve comprehensive coverage.**

**Determine Appropriate Depth Based On**:
- Coverage completeness (all major aspects addressed?)
- Pattern consensus (enough examples to identify common patterns?)
- Source diversity (cross-validated from multiple sources?)
- Anti-pattern documentation (common mistakes identified?)
- Quality threshold met (can someone use this effectively?)

**Guiding Philosophy**:
- Comprehensive coverage > hitting line counts
- Stop when coverage complete, not when reaching arbitrary number
- Quality examples > quantity of examples
- Deep analysis > superficial breadth
- Useful reference > padded content

---

## Adaptive Research Notes

This protocol works for ANY research domain by adapting tool usage:

**For code-heavy domains**: Emphasize GitHub clones, Context7 docs
**For visual domains**: Emphasize Chrome DevTools MCP (3 sites max), web research
**For theoretical domains**: Emphasize Perplexity reasoning, Archon KB, authoritative web sources
**For emerging domains**: Emphasize web search, GitHub trends, experimentation

The structure remains constant - only your tool allocation adapts based on what's available and what's needed for your specific research topic.
