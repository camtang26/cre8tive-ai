## Open Questions

### Business & Strategy:

2. **Pricing Transparency:** Should pricing information be public on the website (and how granular for multi-platform packages)?
3. **Content Strategy:** Is a blog or resources section planned for SEO and thought leadership?
4. **Case Studies:** Should detailed case studies be added beyond gallery examples?
5. **Route Naming:** Keep `/studios-engine` for SEO continuity or shift to `/briefing-engine` for clarity?
6. **Visual Style Assets:** Should gallery cards use bespoke renders or actual platform outputs?
7. **Interactive Demo:** Does the hero need a live brief input demo in Phase 1 or a future iteration?
8. **Product Access CTA:** Should the page drive direct signup, contact/demo request, or both?

### Technical:
1. **Test Coverage:** What level of automated testing is desired? (currently none)
2. **CMS Need:** Will content updates always be via codebase, or is a CMS needed?
3. **Form Backend:** Is getform.io the long-term solution, or should a custom backend be built?

### Compliance:
1. **Accessibility Audit:** Has WCAG compliance been formally tested?
