- 13 documentation files in codex/
- 9 validation screenshots

# Decisions

**2025-10-04: Brownfield Initialization - Comprehensive Documentation**
- Rationale: No SPEC.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, or CONTRIBUTING.md existed; needed foundation docs
- Analysis: Systematic codebase analysis (41 commits, 63 files, React+TypeScript+Vite stack)
- Generated:
  - SPEC.md: Requirements, features, scope boundaries, success metrics (reverse-engineered from code)
  - ARCHITECTURE.md: Tech stack, system design, components, patterns, risks
  - CONTRIBUTING.md: Code conventions, git workflow, testing standards (discovered from code)
  - README.md: Enhanced with comprehensive setup and reference sections
- Key Findings:
  - Modern tech stack: React 18.3, TypeScript 5.5, Vite 5.4, Tailwind 3.4
  - B2B marketing site for AI services (Studios, Agents, Conversational AI)
  - No tests (identified as technical debt)
  - Relaxed TypeScript config (noImplicitAny: false, strictNullChecks: false)
  - GitHub Pages deployment via GitHub Actions to cre8tive.ai
- Result: Solid documentation foundation for ongoing development
- Signed: Claude 4.5 Sonnet (2025-10-04 15:01 NZDT)

**2025-10-02: Modern Design Refresh Complete**
- Rationale: User requested "insanely polished and fresh" redesign
- Implemented: Bento Grid, Glassmorphism 2.0, Magnetic buttons, Bold typography
- Validated: Both dev (8080) and production (4173) builds tested with Chrome DevTools MCP
- Result: Zero critical errors, all design patterns working correctly

**2025-10-02: Button Nesting Fixes**
- Problem: React validateDOMNesting warnings (button inside button)
- Fixed: DesktopServices.tsx and HeroContent.tsx to use MagneticButton `as` prop
- Result: Zero console warnings

**2025-10-02: Chrome DevTools MCP Stability**
- Problem: MCP disconnecting during screenshots (memory exhaustion)
- Fixed: Killed stuck Chrome processes, cleaned orphaned profiles, user cleared swap
- Result: MCP stable, all validations completed successfully

# Open Questions

**From Documentation Analysis:**
1. **GTM ID:** Google Tag Manager ID is placeholder "GTM-XXXXXXX" - needs real ID?
2. **Unused 3D Dependencies:** Three.js/Spline present (~4MB) but limited usage - remove or lazy load?
3. **Testing Strategy:** What level of automated testing is desired? (currently none)
4. **Content Management:** Will updates always be via code, or is a CMS needed long-term?
5. **Lead Volume Targets:** What are the monthly lead generation goals for success metrics?

**Previous:**
None from redesign - all validations complete, redesign ready for deployment

# Next Steps

**Priority 1: Validate Generated Documentation (NEW)**
1. **Review SPEC.md** - Does it capture the actual product/services accurately?
2. **Review ARCHITECTURE.md** - Is tech stack and structure correct?
3. **Review CONTRIBUTING.md** - Do conventions match team preferences?
4. **Fill in placeholders:**
   - GitHub repo URLs (currently `[org]/cre8tive-website`)
   - Google Tag Manager ID (currently `GTM-XXXXXXX`)
   - Any `[undefined]` or `[unknown]` values
5. **Clarify Open Questions** documented in SPEC.md and _MEMO.md

**Priority 2: Immediate (From Redesign)**
1. User should manually test the website in browser (http://localhost:8080)
2. Verify all interactions work (magnetic buttons, scroll animations, hover effects)
3. Consider creating pull request to merge `design/modern-refresh-2025-10-02` into `main`

**Priority 3: Optional Improvements**
1. Remove unused Spline/Three.js dependencies (~4MB) if InteractiveRobot remains disabled
2. Update browserslist data: `npx update-browserslist-db@latest`
3. Test on mobile devices and other browsers (Firefox, Safari)
4. **Implement testing** - Start with Vitest for unit tests (see CONTRIBUTING.md)
5. **Enable stricter TypeScript** - Gradually turn on noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks

**Priority 4: Future Enhancements**
1. Consider performance optimizations (lazy load more components)
2. Add Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals testing
3. A/B test new design vs old design
4. **CMS Integration** - If frequent content updates needed (Sanity, Contentful)
5. **Blog/Resources Section** - For SEO and thought leadership
